  title = "Fundamentals of Nuclear Reactor Physics",
  abstract = "This new streamlined text offers a one-semester treatment of the 
    essentials of how the fission nuclear reactor works, the various approaches
    to the design of reactors, and their safe and efficient operation. The book 
    includes numerous worked-out examples and end-of-chapter questions to help 
    reinforce the knowledge presented. This textbook offers an 
    engineering-oriented introduction to nuclear physics, with a particular
    focus on how those physics are put to work in the service of generating 
    nuclear-based power, particularly the importance of neutron reactions and 
    neutron behavior. Engineering students will find this applications-oriented 
    approach, with many worked-out examples, more accessible and more meaningful 
    as they aspire to become future nuclear engineers. A clear, general overview 
    of atomic physics from the standpoint of reactor functionality and design, 
    including the sequence of fission reactions and their energy release 
    In-depth discussion of neutron reactions, including neutron kinetics and the 
    neutron energy spectrum, as well as neutron spatial distribution Ample 
    worked-out examples and over 100 end-of-chapter problems Full Solutions
