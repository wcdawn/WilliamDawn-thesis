\section{Introduction}
  This application of the FEM has been compared against reference 
  benchmark problems as well as analytic solutions. Comparison
  against benchmark problems demonstrates an ability to solve problems for
  which this application was intended. Comparison against analytic solutions 
  allows for more detailed error and convergence analysis as not only the system
  $\keff$ but also the flux solution are known exactly. 

  Running these comparisons serves as a verification and validation of this
  implementation of the FEM. The strategy used comes from \cite{oberkampf}. The
  first step is ``solution verification.'' Solution verification compares
  computational results to exact analytic results. Verification serves to
  demonstrate that the code itself is solving the correct equations as designed.
  This will be demonstrated with convergence to the analytic answer at the
  expected rate. The second step is ``solution validation.'' Solution validation
  compares computational results to benchmark results which may have been
  calculated computationally via another method or may come from experimental
  data. Validation demonstrates an ability to solve problems for which the
  method was originally intended. The data of the benchmark is not exact, but
  typically the solution has been verified by others previously.

\section{Error Analysis}
  For all reference problems presented, a convergence study is presented. It has 
  been shown that given a bounded second spatial derivative within the problem 
  domain, the FEM derived above is second-order convergent in space
  \cite{textbookli} (Remark 7.13). Mathematically, this is expressed
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:error_bound}
    \|\ve\|_{\infty} \le c h^2 \| \grad^2 \phi(\vr) \|_{\infty}
  \end{equation}
  where $\ve$ is the error vector such that $\ve = \phi(\vr) - \phi_{FEM}$ and
  $\phi_{FEM}$ is solution to the finite element system of equations. In
  \eref{eq:error_bound} $h$ is the characteristic mesh size, and $c$ is a 
  constant.  \eref{eq:error_bound} implies that if the characteristic mesh size
  is halved, the error is quartered. This relationship is useful as a proper 
  implementation of the FEM must converge to the correct answer and do so at the 
  correct rate.
  
  Mesh refinement studies are presented herein. For each refinement, $h$ is 
  halved by introducing new elements and placing new nodes at the midway point
  between existing nodes. Then, let $i$ be the refinement index and the
  refinement ratio for a second-order convergent method is 
  \begin{equation}
    r = 4 = \frac{x^{(i-1)}}{x^{(i)}}
  \end{equation}
  such that for some quantity $x$, the error should theoretically decrease by a
  factor of four for each refinement. As these are numerical solutions, the 
  ratio rarely equals exactly four. It is observed that a few refinements are 
  often necessary before the ratio approaches the expected value. This is 
  especially the case when the second derivative is not bounded in problems with 
  heterogeneous materials.
  
  For benchmark problems, only $\keff$ is analyzed and expected to converge
  at the appropriate rate because the neutron flux solution is not known 
  exactly. When assembly powers were available, these are also
  presented graphically. In the graphical power representation, the key is 
  presented in \fref{fig:hex_description}.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{hex_description}
    \caption{Key for Hexagonal Power Plots.}
    \label{fig:hex_description}
  \end{figure}
  
  For analytic solutions, the error of the function $\phi$ itself can be 
  analyzed because the solution is known exactly. The derivations of the exact 
  solutions are presented in \apref{ap:analyticSolutions}. For all analytic 
  problems, the Root Mean Squared (RMS) error as in \eref{eq:rms} is calculated
  for the error vector $\ve$ and is presented. The ratio between refinements 
  should assume the expected rate. RMS error is defined as
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:rms}
    \text{RMS}(\ve) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i}.
  \end{equation}
  The maximal norm $\| \cdot \|_{\infty}$ is also presented and the ratio 
  between refinements should assume the expected rate. The maximal norm of the
  error is defined as
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:infnorm}
    \|\ve\|_{\infty} = \max_{i=1,2,\ldots,N} \lvert e_i \rvert.
  \end{equation}
  For analytic criticality  problems, $\keff$ is also presented and the ratio 
  between refinements should assume the expected rate. $\keff$ error is 
  calculated with \eref{eq:keff_err} in units of Percent Mille \units{pcm} from 
  \eref{eq:pcm}.
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:keff_err}
    \keff \; \text{ error } &= \kref - \keff \\
    \label{eq:pcm}
    x \units{pcm} &= x \times 10^5
  \end{align}

\section{Reference Results}
  Comparison of numerical solutions to analytical and benchmark solutions
  follow. Each of these sets of results include a mesh refinement study to
  observe the proper convergence at the expected rate of four.

  \subsection{Analytic Solutions}
    As a demonstration of the proper implementation of and solution to the 
    neutron diffusion equation, analytic solutions are derived and then 
    numerically computed. These are one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and 
    three-dimensional problems. These problems exercise both triangle and wedge 
    elements. For one-dimension problems a two-dimensional rectangular domain is
    used and, the top and bottom edges $y=0$ and $y=L_x$ are treated as mirror 
    boundary conditions to reduce the dimension of the problem. To verify there
    was no error obscured by this process, the results were reproduced for a 
    rotated problem with the left and right edges ($x=0$ and $x=L_x$) set to
    mirror boundary conditions as well.

  \subsection{Benchmark Solutions}
    \label{sec:benchmark_solutions}
    The application presented here was designed simulate nuclear power reactors,
    both SFRs and other reactor designs. Two-dimension and three-dimension
    benchmark problems with similar reactor physics phenomena have been examined
    here. These problems come from existing benchmarks based on hexagonal 
    geometry. This collection of benchmarks represent various energy group 
    structures, geometries, assembly sizes,  boundary conditions, as well as 
    other properties. Data used in these problems is concisely presented in 
    \apref{ap:benchmarks}.
    
    For two-dimensional benchmarks, mesh refinement studies are provided and 
    convergence is observed relative to the reference $\keff$ value similar to
    analytic problems. For three-dimensional benchmarks, control rod worth
    measurement is instead used to observe agreement of the diffusion solution 
    to the benchmark solution. To measure control rod worth, three cases are run
    $\{A,B,C\}$ with control rods fully removed in case $A$, partially inserted
    in case $B$, and fully inserted in case $C$. Rod worth is presented in 
    units \units{$\Delta k$} and calculated as 
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:rodworth}
      \text{Rod Worth}_x = \frac{\keffsub{A} - \keffsub{x}}
        {\keffsub{A} \, \keffsub{x}}
    \end{equation}
    for $x = \{B,C\}$. That is, rod worth is always compared to the case with
    control rods fully removed, case $A$. Additionally, Rod Difference is
    presented in units \units{$\% \Delta$k} as
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:roddifference}
      \text{Rod Difference} &= \keffsub{A} - \keffsub{x} \\
      x \% \Delta \text{k}  &= x \times 10^2
    \end{align}
    for $x = \{B,C\}$.


    \subsubsection{VVER440}
      Proposed in \cite{chao} and described in \sref{sec:vver440}, this
      benchmark, two-dimensional problem is based on a
      VVER-440 reactor. The VVER-440 is a 
      light-water moderated reactor and operates principally with thermal 
      neutron spectrum. Cross sections are provided for a two-group energy 
      structure.

    \subsubsection{IAEA}
      Proposed in \cite{chao} and described in \sref{sec:iaea}, this
      reactory-type, two-dimensional problem was originally based on a cartesian
      grid two-dimensional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) but was converted to
      hexagonal geometry in \cite{chao}. As it is based on a PWR deisgn, the
      reactor operates principally with thermal spectrum. Cross sections are
      provided for a two-group energy structure.

      The reactor is presented in four scenarios; both with and without
      reflective assemblies as well as with $\albedo = 0.125$ and $\albedo =
      0.5$. Numerical mesh convergence studies are presented for the quantity
      $\keff$ for each case in each of \tref{tab:iaea_nore0125},
      \tref{tab:iaea_nore0500}, \tref{tab:iaea_refl0125}, and
      \tref{tab:iaea_refl0500}.

    \subsubsection{MONJU}
      Proposed in \cite{monjuBenchmark} and described in \sref{sec:monju}, this 
      three-dimension, reactory-type problem is based on a Sodium-cooled Fast
      Reactor (SFR) operating principally with fast neutrons. Cross sections are
      provided for a three-group energy structure. However, the fission spectrum
      is not provided and is selcted for benchmark agreement. This assumed
      fission spectrum is presented in \tref{tab:monjuchi}. The rod worth
      measurements appear insensitive to fission spectrum. 

      Reference data can be found in \tref{tab:monjukeff}. Results from the
      finite element application are presented in \tref{tab:monju}. The error
      (difference between reference and calculated results) are presented in
      parenthesis next to the quantities. 
      Rod Worth is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:rodworth}. Rod Difference
      is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:roddifference}.

    \subsubsection{KNK}
      Proposed in \cite{takedaBenchmark} and described in \sref{sec:knk}, this
      three-dimension, benchmark problem is based on a SFR and is a model of
      the KNK-II core. Cross sections are provided for a four-group energy
      structure. There are many materials specified in the problem so it also
      aids in testing material mapping in a code. However, the reference data is
      for a transport solution. In this application, the transport cross
      sections are used to solve the neutron diffusion equation. This explains
      some of the numerical differences in the results but general trends are
      reflected. In addition to the comparison to the reference transport
      solution, the neutron diffusion equation is solved with DIF3D and the
      finite element results are comporable to the finite difference solution. 

      Reference data can be found in \tref{tab:knkkeff}. Results from the Finite
      Element neutron diffusion application are presented in \tref{tab:knk}. The
      error (difference between reference and calculated results) are presented
      in parenthesis next to the quantities.
      Rod Worth is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:rodworth}. Rod Difference
      is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:roddifference}.
