\section{Introduction}
  The implementation of the \gls{fem} in this work has been compared
  against standard benchmark problems as well as analytic solutions. Comparison 
  against benchmark problems demonstrates an ability to solve problems for which 
  this work was intended. Comparison against analytic solutions allows for more 
  detailed error and convergence analysis as not only the system $\keff$ but 
  also the flux solution are known exactly. 

  Running these comparisons serves as a verification of this implementation of 
  the \gls{fem}. The strategy used comes from \cite{oberkampf}. The first step is 
  ``code verification.'' Code verification compares computational results to 
  exact analytic or manufactured results. Code verification serves to 
  demonstrate that the code itself is solving the equations correctly as 
  designed and with quantified numerical errors. This will be demonstrated with 
  convergence to the analytic answer at the expected rate. The second step is 
  ``solution verification.'' Solution verification compares computational 
  results to benchmark results for the intended application of the solver. These 
  benchmarks may have been been calculated computationally via another method or 
  may come from experimental data.  The data of the standard benchmarks is not 
  exact, but typically the solution has been verified by others previously.

\section{Error Analysis}
  For all benchmark and analytic problems solved, a convergence study is 
  presented. Define an error vector $\ve = \phi(\vr) - \phi_{FEM}$ where
  $\phi_{FEM}$ is the solution to the finite element system of equations. Then, 
  error is considered in terms of both Root Mean Squared (RMS) error calculated 
  as 
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:rms}
    \text{RMS}(\ve) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2},
  \end{equation}
  and error is considered in the maximal norm calculated as
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:infnorm}
    \|\ve\|_{\infty} = \max_{i=1,2,\ldots,N} \lvert e_i \rvert.
  \end{equation}

  It has been shown that for a bounded second spatial derivative 
  within the problem domain, the \gls{fem} derived in \chref{ch:neutronDiffusion} 
  is second-order convergent in space (\cite{textbookli} Remark 7.13).
  This implies the error in the maximal norm defined in \eref{eq:infnorm} is
  bounded as
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:error_bound}
    \|\ve\|_{\infty} \le c h^2 \| \grad^2 \phi(\vr) \|_{\infty}
  \end{equation}
  where $\ve$ is the error vector, $h$ is the characteristic mesh size, and $c$
  is a constant. \eref{eq:error_bound} implies that if the characteristic mesh 
  size is halved, the error is quartered. This relationship is useful as a 
  proper implementation of the \gls{fem} must converge to the correct answer and 
  do so at the correct rate.
  
  Mesh refinement studies are presented herein. For each refinement, $h$ is 
  halved by introducing new elements and placing new nodes at the midway point
  between existing nodes. Then, let $i$ be the refinement index and the
  refinement ratio for a second-order convergent method is 
  \begin{equation}
    4 = \frac{x^{(i-1)}}{x^{(i)}}
  \end{equation}
  such that for some quantity $x$, the error should theoretically decrease by a
  factor of four for each refinement. As these are numerical solutions, the 
  ratio rarely equals exactly four. It is observed that a few refinements are 
  often necessary before the ratio approaches the expected value. This is 
  especially the case when the second derivative is not bounded in problems with 
  heterogeneous materials.
  
  For benchmark problems, only $\keff$ is analyzed and expected to converge
  at the appropriate rate because the neutron flux solution is not known 
  exactly. When assembly powers were available, these are also
  presented graphically. In the graphical power representation, the key is 
  presented in \fref{fig:hex_description}.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{hex_description}
    \caption{Key for Hexagonal Power Plots.}
    \label{fig:hex_description}
  \end{figure}
  
  For analytic solutions, the error of the function $\phi$ itself can be 
  analyzed because the solution is known exactly. The derivations of the exact 
  solutions are presented in \apref{ap:analyticSolutions}. 
  For analytic criticality  problems, $\keff$ is also presented and the ratio 
  between refinements should assume the expected rate. $\keff$ error is 
  calculated with \eref{eq:keff_err} in units of Percent Mille, \units{pcm}.
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:keff_err}
    \keff \; \text{ error } \units{pcm} = (\kref - \keff) \times 10^5
  \end{equation}

\section{Analytic Solutions}
  As a demonstration of the proper implementation of and solution to the 
  neutron diffusion equation, analytic solutions are derived and then 
  numerically computed. These are one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and 
  three-dimensional problems. These problems exercise both triangle and wedge 
  elements. For one-dimension problems, a two-dimensional rectangular domain is
  used and the top and bottom edges, $y=0$ and $y=L_x$, are treated as mirror 
  boundary conditions to reduce the dimension of the problem. To verify there
  was no error obscured by this process, the results were reproduced for a 
  rotated problem with the left and right edges ($x=0$ and $x=L_x$) set to
  mirror boundary conditions as well.

\section{Two-Dimension Benchmark Solutions}
  \label{sec:two_dimensional_benchmark_solutions}
  The work presented here was designed simulate nuclear power reactors with
  special attention to fast reactor applications. However, the solution to the
  multigroup neutron diffusion equation remains general for all power reactors.
  In this section, two-dimension 
  benchmark problems with similar reactor physics phenomena have been examined.
  These problems come from existing benchmarks based on hexagonal 
  geometry. Initial refinement is based on six triangles per hexagon and
  these triangles are split with each refinement. This collection of benchmarks 
  represent various energy group 
  structures, geometries, assembly sizes,  boundary conditions, as well as 
  other properties. Data used in these problems is concisely presented in 
  \apref{ap:benchmarks}. Mesh refinement studies are provided and convergence is
  observed relative to the reference \keff value similar to analytic problems.
  
  \subsection{VVER440}
    Proposed in \cite{chao} and described in \sref{sec:vver440}, this
    benchmark is a two-dimensional hexagonal problem based on a
    VVER-440 reactor. The VVER-440 is a 
    light-water moderated reactor and operates principally with thermal 
    neutron spectrum. Cross sections are provided for a two-group energy 
    structure.
    
    Power comparison between the most refined mesh and the reference solution 
    are presented graphically in \fref{fig:diffusion_vver440} according to the
    key in \fref{fig:hex_description}. Numerical mesh convergence study for 
    the quantity $\keff$ is presented in \tref{tab:vver440}.

    neutrons. Cross sections are provided for a four-group energy structure.

  \subsection{IAEA}
    Proposed in \cite{chao} and described in \sref{sec:iaea}, this
    two-dimensional problem was originally based on a cartesian
    grid two-dimensional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) but was converted to
    hexagonal geometry to represent a VVER reactor in \cite{chao}. As it is
    originally based on a PWR design, the reactor operates principally with a 
    thermal neutron spectrum. Cross sections are provided for a two-group energy 
    structure.

    The reactor is presented in four scenarios; both with and without
    reflective assemblies as well as with $\albedo = 0.125$ and $\albedo =
    0.5$. Numerical mesh convergence studies are presented for the quantity
    $\keff$ for each case in each of \tref{tab:iaea_nore0125},

\section{Three-Dimension Benchmark Solutions}
  \label{sec:three_dimensional_benchmark_solutions}
  For two-dimensional benchmarks, mesh refinement studies are provided and 
  convergence is observed relative to the reference $\keff$ value similar to
  analytic problems. For three-dimensional benchmarks, control rod worth
  measurement is instead used to observe agreement of the diffusion solution 
  to the benchmark solution. To measure control rod worth, three cases are run
  $\{A,B,C\}$ with control rods fully removed in case $A$, partially inserted
  in case $B$, and fully inserted in case $C$. 
  Rod worth is presented in 
  units \units{$\Delta k$} and calculated as 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rodworth}
    \text{Rod Worth}_x \units{$\Delta k$} = \frac{\keffsub{A} - \keffsub{x}}
      {\keffsub{A} \, \keffsub{x}}
  \end{equation}
  for $x = \{B,C\}$. That is, rod worth is always compared to the case with
  control rods fully removed, case $A$. Additionally, Rod Difference is
  presented in units \units{$\% \Delta$k} as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:roddifference}
    \text{Rod Difference}_x \units{$\% \Delta k$} = (\keffsub{A} - \keffsub{x}) 
      \times 100 \%
  \end{equation}
  for $x = \{B,C\}$.

  \subsection{MONJU}
    Proposed in \cite{monjuBenchmark} and described in \sref{sec:monju}, this 
    three-dimension fast reactor benchmark problem is based on an \gls{sfr}
    operating principally with fast neutrons. Cross sections are provided for a 
    three-group energy structure. However, the fission spectrum, $\chi$, is not
    provided in the specifications. Instead, a fission spectrum is selected for 
    benchmark agreement. This assumed fission spectrum is presented in 
    \tref{tab:monjuchi}. The rod worth measurements appear insensitive to the
    choice of fission spectrum. 

    Reference data can be found in \tref{tab:monjukeff}. Results from the
    finite element method implementation are presented in \tref{tab:monju}. 
    The error (difference between reference and calculated results) are 
    presented in parenthesis next to the quantities. 
    Rod Worth is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:rodworth}. Rod Difference
    is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:roddifference}.

  \subsection{KNK}
    Proposed in \cite{takedaBenchmark} and described in \sref{sec:knk}, this
    three-dimension, benchmark problem is based on an \gls{sfr} and is a model 
    of the KNK-II core. Cross sections are provided for a four-group energy
    structure. There are many materials specified in the problem so it also
    aids in testing material mapping in the code. However, the reference data is
    for a transport solution. In this work, the cross-sections from the
    transport problem are used to solve the neutron diffusion equation. This 
    explains some of the numerical differences in the results but general 
    trends are reflected. 

    Reference data can be found in \tref{tab:knkkeff}. Results from the finite
    element neutron diffusion solution are presented in \tref{tab:knk}. The
    error (difference between reference and calculated results) are presented
    in parenthesis next to the quantities.
    Rod Worth is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:rodworth}. Rod Difference
    is presented as calculated in \eref{eq:roddifference}.
