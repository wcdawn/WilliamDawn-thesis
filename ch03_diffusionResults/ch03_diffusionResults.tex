\chapter{Neutron Diffusion Results}
\label{ch:diffusionResults}

\section{Introduction}
  The implementation of the \gls{fem} in this work has been compared
  against standard benchmark problems as well as analytic solutions to the
  multigroup neutron diffusion equation. Comparison against benchmark problems
  demonstrates an ability to solve problems for which this work was intended.
  Comparison against analytic solutions allows for more detailed error and
  convergence analysis as not only the system $\keff$ but also the flux solution
  are known exactly. 

  These comparisons serve as a verification of this implementation of the
  \gls{fem}. The verificaiton strategy employed in this work is developed by
  \textcite{oberkampf}. The first step is ``code verification.'' Code
  verification compares computational results to exact analytic or manufactured
  results. Code verification serves to demonstrate that the code itself is
  solving the equations correctly as designed and with quantified numerical
  errors. This will be demonstrated with convergence to the analytic answer at
  the expected rate. The second step is ``solution verification.'' Solution
  verification compares computational results to benchmark results for the
  intended application of the solver. These benchmarks may have been been
  calculated computationally via another method or may come from experimental
  data. The data of the standard benchmarks is not exact; but, typically the
  benchmark solution has been verified by others previously.

\section{Error Analysis}
  For all benchmark and analytic problems solved, a convergence study is 
  presented. Define an error vector $\ve = \phi(\vr) - \phi_{FEM}$ where
  $\phi_{FEM}$ is the solution to the \gls{fem} system of equations. Then, 
  error is considered in terms of both \gls{rms} error calculated as 
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:rms}
    \text{\gls{rms}}(\ve) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2},
  \end{equation}
  and error is considered in the maximal norm calculated as
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:infnorm}
    \|\ve\|_{\infty} = \max_{i=1,2,\ldots,N} \lvert e_i \rvert.
  \end{equation}

  It has been shown that for a bounded second spatial derivative 
  within the problem domain, the \gls{fem} with linear elements as derived in 
  \chref{ch:neutronDiffusion} is second-order convergent in space 
  \cite{textbookli}. This implies the error in the maximal norm defined in 
  \eref{eq:infnorm} is bounded as
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:error_bound}
    \|\ve\|_{\infty} \le c h^2 \| \grad^2 \phi(\vr) \|_{\infty}
  \end{equation}
  where $\ve$ is the error vector, $h$ is the characteristic mesh size, and $c$
  is a constant. \eref{eq:error_bound} implies that if the characteristic mesh 
  size is halved, the error is quartered. This relationship is useful as a 
  proper implementation of the \gls{fem} must converge to the correct answer and 
  do so at the correct rate.
  
  Mesh refinement studies are presented herein. For each refinement, $h$ is 
  halved by introducing new elements and placing new nodes at the midway point
  between existing nodes. Let $i$ be the refinement index and the refinement 
  ratio for a second-order convergent method is 
  \begin{equation}
    4 = \frac{x^{(i-1)}}{x^{(i)}}
  \end{equation}
  such that for some quantity $x$, the error should theoretically decrease by a
  factor of four for each refinement. As these are numerical solutions, the 
  ratio rarely equals exactly four. It is observed that a few refinements are 
  often necessary before the convergence reaches the asymptotic regime and the 
  ratio approaches the expected value. This is especially the case when the 
  second derivative is not bounded in problems with heterogeneous materials.
  
  For analytic solutions, the error of the function $\phi(\vr)$ itself can be 
  analyzed because the solution is known exactly. The derivations of the exact 
  solutions are presented in \apref{ap:analyticSolutions}. Both RMS errors and
  maximal errors are presented. It is observed that the RMS error refinement
  ratio approaches the expected value of four before the maximal error
  refinement ratio because the RMS error is an integral quantity over the
  problem domain whereas the maximal error is a point-wise quantity.

  For analytic criticality  problems, $\keff$ is also presented and the ratio
  between refinements should assume the expected rate. Though the convergence is
  defined in \eref{eq:error_bound} is for the flux itself, $\keff$ is expected
  to  converge at the same rate.  $\keff$ error is calculated with
  \eref{eq:keff_err} in units of percent-mille~\units{\glsentryshort{pcm}}.
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:keff_err}
    \keff \; \text{ error } \units{\glsentryshort{pcm}} = (\kref - \keff) 
      \times 10^5
  \end{equation}

  For benchmark problems, only $\keff$ is analyzed and expected to converge
  at approximately the appropriate rate because the neutron flux solution is not 
  known exactly. However, the magnitude of the error and the convergence rate
  will both be influenced by the quality of the benchmark. For example, a
  benchmark that specifies $\keff$ to only a few significant figures cannot be 
  expected to converge to an error smaller than the least significant digit. 
  When assembly powers were available, these are also presented graphically. 
  % this is used to put the key over top of figures. really hacky.

\section{Analytic Solutions}
  As a demonstration of the proper implementation of and solution to the neutron
  diffusion equation, analytic solutions are derived and then computed
  numerically. These are one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional
  problems. These problems exercise both triangle and wedge elements. For
  one-dimensional problems, a two-dimensional rectangular domain is used and the
  top and bottom edges, $y=0$ and $y=L_x$, are treated as mirror boundary
  conditions to reduce the dimension of the problem. To verify there was no
  error obscured by this process, the results were reproduced for a rotated
  problem with the left and right edges ($x=0$ and $x=L_x$) set to mirror
  boundary conditions as well.

  \subsection{One-Dimension, One-Group, Fixed Source}
    \label{sec:1dfixedsrc}
    Arguably the simplest solution to the neutron diffusion equation, this
    problem consists of a fixed unit source throughout the  problem. The exact 
    solution is derived in \sref{sec:deriv_1dfixedsrc} and is presented in

    presented in \tref{tab:1dfixedsrc}.

  \subsection{One-Dimension, Two-Group, Criticality }

    This problem tests the solution of multigroup problems. The results 
    presented are the convergence of $\keff$ and the convergence of the ratio
    of relative magnitude of thermal to fast flux $\phi_2/\phi_1$. A proof is
    not provided that the relative magnitude should observe the expected
    convergence rate. However, the method is second-order convergent and the
    expected convergence rate is, in fact, observed.

    The exact solutions are derived in \sref{sec:deriv_1d2g} and
    the solutions are presented in \eref{eq:1d2g_1} and
    \eref{eq:1d2g_2}. Results from the convergence study are presented in 
    \tref{tab:1d2g}. The exact value for the effective multiplication factor 
    is $\kref = 0.892349$ and the exact value for the relative flux ratio
    is $(\phi_2/\phi_1)_{ref} = 0.261324$.

  \subsection{One-Dimension, One-Group, Two-Region, Criticality}
    This problem tests the mapping of materials to regions within the problem.
    The exact solution is derived in \sref{sec:deriv_2reg} and presented in
    \eref{eq:analytic_2reg}. Results from the convergence study are presented in
    \tref{tab:2reg}. The exact value for the effective multiplication factor is
    $\kref = 0.962188$. The results in \tref{tab:2reg} show that the convergence
    of $\keff$ quickly achieves the expected convergence ratio of four. However,
    the RMS error and maximal errors do not appear to be approaching four
    quickly. This is attributed to the nature of the problem. Recall the
    statement of the convergence order required a bounded second 
    derivative of the flux as in \eref{eq:error_bound}. The second derivative of
    the flux in this problem is unbounded due to the material discontinuity. It
    is observed that the maximal error occurs at the change of material
    properties.

  \subsection{Three-Dimension, One-Group, Finite Cylinder}
    This problem is a finite cylinder composed of fissile material.  The
    solution with the \gls{fem} uses a three-dimensional solution and wedge
    finite elements. The exact solution is derived in
    \sref{sec:deriv_finite_cyl} and the solution is presented in
    \eref{eq:analytic_finite_cyl}. Results from the convergence study are
    presented in \tref{tab:finite_cyl}. The exact value for the effective
    multiplication factor is $\kref = 0.996711$. 
    
    It is observed in \tref{tab:finite_cyl} that the convergence rate of the
    flux appears to fluctuate about the expected value of four. This is
    attributed to the process of refining circular meshes. Previously, the mesh
    was refined by simply introducing additional nodes at the midpoint between
    existing nodes. With a circular (or curved) mesh, this is not acceptable. It
    is necessary to totally regenerate the mesh for each refinement so that the
    problem boundary may be better approximated. For example, if only six nodes
    were on the problem boundary in the zeroth refinement, the cylinder would be
    approximated as a hexagon throughout the mesh refinement study. This mesh
    regeneration necessity means that the nodes are moving throughout the domain
    during refinement process. For an illustration of the nodes moving, see
    \fref{fig:ch03_circle_meshes}.

      \label{fig:ch03_circle_meshes}
    \end{figure}
    
    \tref{tab:finite_cyl} shows that for refinement two, the refinement ratio is
    especially poor. However, for refinement three, the refinement ratio is
    roughly twice the expected rate.  Therefore, on average, the flux appears to
    be converging at the correct rate despite difficulties with mesh
    regeneration.

\section{Two-Dimension Benchmark Solutions}
  \label{sec:two_dimensional_benchmark_solutions}
  The work presented here was designed simulate nuclear power reactors with
  special attention to fast reactor applications. However, the solution to the
  multigroup neutron diffusion equation remains general for all power reactors.
  In this section, two-dimension nuclear reactor benchmark problems have been
  examined.  These problems come from existing benchmarks based on hexagonal
  geometry. Initial refinement is based on six triangles per hexagon and these
  triangles are split with each refinement. This collection of benchmarks
  represents various energy group structures, geometries, assembly sizes,
  boundary conditions, as well as other properties. Data used in these problems
  is concisely presented in \apref{ap:benchmarks}. Mesh refinement studies are
  provided and convergence is observed relative to the reference \keff value
  similar to analytic problems. Recall that the convergence rate and the error
  of the converged $\keff$ value will both be effected by the quality of the
  benchmark.
  
  \subsection{VVER440}
    Proposed by \textcite{chao} and described in
    \sref{sec:vver440}, this benchmark is a two-dimensional hexagonal problem
    based on a VVER-440 reactor. The VVER-440 is a \gls{lwr} and, as such, 
    operates principally with thermal neutron spectrum. Cross sections are
    provided for a two-group energy structure.
    
    Power comparison between the most refined mesh and the reference solution
    are presented graphically in \fref{fig:diffusion_vver440}. Numerical mesh
    convergence study for the quantity $\keff$ is presented in
    \tref{tab:vver440}.

  \subsection{SNR}
    Proposed in the Argonne Code Center Benchmark Problem Book
    \cite{argonneBenchmark} and described in \sref{sec:snr}, this benchmark is a
    two-dimensional problem based on the SNR reactor. The SNR is a \gls{sfr} and
    operates principally with fast neutrons. Cross sections are provided for a
    four-group energy structure.

    Power comparison between the most refined mesh and numerical solution given
    by \dif are presented graphically in \fref{fig:diffusion_snr} (the benchmark
    does not specify a power distribution). A numerical mesh convergence study 
    for the quantity $\keff$ is presented in \tref{tab:snr}.

  \subsection{IAEA}
    Proposed by \textcite{chao} and described in \sref{sec:iaea}, this
    two-dimensional problem was originally based on a two-dimensional \gls{pwr}
    with a Cartesian grid. The benchmark was converted to hexagonal geometry to
    represent a VVER reactor \cite{chao}. As it is originally based on a
    \gls{pwr} design, the reactor operates principally with a thermal neutron
    spectrum. Cross sections are provided for a two-group energy structure.

    The reactor is presented in four scenarios; both with and without
    reflective assemblies as well as with $\albedo = 0.125$ and $\albedo =
    0.5$. Numerical mesh convergence studies are presented for the quantity
    $\keff$ for each case in each of \tref{tab:iaea_nore0125},
    \tref{tab:iaea_nore0500}, \tref{tab:iaea_refl0125}, and

\section{Three-Dimension Benchmark Solutions}
  \label{sec:three_dimensional_benchmark_solutions}
  For two-dimensional benchmarks, mesh refinement studies are provided and
  convergence is observed relative to the reference $\keff$ value similar to
  analytic problems. For three-dimensional benchmarks, control rod worth
  measurement is used to observe agreement of the \gls{fem} neutron diffusion
  solution to the benchmark solution. To measure control rod worth, three cases
  are run $\{A,B,C\}$ with control rods fully removed in case $A$, partially
  inserted in case $B$, and fully inserted in case $C$. Rod worth is presented
  in units \units{$\Delta k$} and calculated as 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rodworth}
    \text{Rod Worth}_x \units{$\Delta k$} = \frac{\keffsub{A} - \keffsub{x}}
      {\keffsub{A} \, \keffsub{x}}
  \end{equation}
  for $x = \{B,C\}$. That is, rod worth is always compared to the case with
  control rods fully removed, case $A$. Additionally, Rod Difference is
  presented in units \units{$\% \Delta$k} as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:roddifference}
    \text{Rod Difference}_x \units{$\% \Delta k$} = (\keffsub{A} - \keffsub{x}) 
      \times 100 \%
  \end{equation}
  for $x = \{B,C\}$.

  \subsection{MONJU}
    Proposed by \textcite{monjuBenchmark} and described in 
    \sref{sec:monju}, this three-dimension fast reactor benchmark problem is 
    based on an \gls{sfr} operating principally with fast neutrons. Cross 
    sections are provided for a three-group energy structure. However, the 
    fission spectrum, $\chi$, is not provided in the specifications. 
    Instead, a fission spectrum is selected for benchmark agreement. This 
    assumed fission spectrum is presented in \tref{tab:monjuchi}. The rod worth 
    measurements appear insensitive to the choice of fission spectrum. 

    Reference data can be found in \tref{tab:monjukref}. Results from the
    \gls{fem} implementation are presented in \tref{tab:monju}. The error
    (difference between reference and calculated results) are presented in
    parenthesis next to the quantities. Rod worth is presented as calculated in
    \eref{eq:rodworth}. Rod difference is presented as calculated in
    \eref{eq:roddifference}.

  \subsection{KNK}
    Proposed by \textcite{takedaBenchmark} and described in \sref{sec:knk}, this
    three-dimension benchmark problem is based on an \gls{sfr} and is a model of
    the KNK-II core. Cross sections are provided for a four-group energy
    structure. There are many materials specified in the problem so it also aids
    in testing material mapping in the code.  The reference data is for a
    solution to the neutron \textit{transport} equation. In this work, the cross
    sections from the transport problem are used to solve the neutron diffusion
    equation. This explains some of the numerical differences in the results but
    general trends are reflected. 

    Reference data can be found in \tref{tab:knkkref}. Results from the
    \gls{fem} neutron diffusion solution are presented in \tref{tab:knk}. The
    error (difference between reference and calculated results) are presented in
    parenthesis next to the quantities. Rod worth is presented as calculated in
    \eref{eq:rodworth}. Rod difference is presented as calculated in
    \eref{eq:roddifference}.
