\section{Discussion of Simulation Results}

  The purpose of this thesis is to simulate a Fast Reactor (FR) at operating
  reactor power conditions with coupled multiphysics simulations. The method
  developed allows for solution to the multigroup neutron diffusion equation for
  general unstructured mesh. The coupled multiphysics models allows for inherent
  modeling instead of thermal feedback effects instead of using extremely
  simplified and manual models. By including all simulations in a single
  simulation suite, a user can more easily observe the interaction of 
  physical phenomena and feedback.

  In \chref{ch:neutronDiffusion}, a rigorous and general framework is developed
  for solving the multigroup neutron diffusion equation using the FEM for
  general unstructured mesh. Insights are provided into the use of both
  two-dimension triangular elements and three-dimensional wedge (pentahedral)
  elements. Both of these geometries are natural choices for FRs which typically
  employ hexagonal geometries. Using the developed methods,
  \chref{ch:diffusionResults} then demonstrates solution verification and
  solution validation for both analytic and reactor benchmark problems. The
  multigroup neutron diffusion solver as implemented is shown to converge to the
  correct answer at the correct convergence rate.

  \chref{ch:thermalHydraulics} presents the details of the thermal hydraulic
  models employed. These models include an axial convection model and a radial
  conduction model. The results of the thermal hydraulic calculations are
  material temperatures that are used to interpolate cross-section tables and
  update coolant density to generate temperature-dependent cross-sections.

  In \chref{ch:thermalExpansion}, a simplified thermal expansion model is
  presented. The model expands materials linearly assuming expansion as either
  HT9 Stainless-Steel structural material or U10Zr fuel material. The model
  requires an \textit{a priori} assumption of material temperatures but results
  are not highly sensitive to these temperatures due to the magnitudes of
  thermal expansion coefficients.

  Finally, \chref{ch:coupledResults} presents the culmination of all models
  implemented. A typical FR as presented in a benchmark problem is simulated.
  Using the models developed, reactivity coefficients can be estimated for an
  operating reactor. These coefficients describe dynamic reactor behavior and
  agree with expected values. These reactivity coefficients also describe the
  mechanisms for inherent safety in a FR.

\section{Conclusions}
  
  It has been demonstrated that the FEM can be used to efficiently simulate the
  power distribution in a nuclear power reactor. Use of the FEM has allowed for 
  the local simulation of multiphysics effects within elements. By simulating
  thermal hydraulic feedback and thermal expansion effects, reactivity effects
  are estimated. Prior to this coupling method, the simulation of feedback
  effects required either manual iterative process between thermal hydraulic 
  codes and neutron diffusion codes or the use of simplified estimates of 
  temperatures. 
  
\section{Recommendations for Future Research}

  The results of this thesis demonstrate a framework for an all-in-one reactor 
  simulator for FR simulations. Future work includes code enhancements,
  added features, and simulation of new reactors. Ultimately, the goal is to
  develop a reactor simulation suite that can be used to perform core design
  calculations and analyze dynamic reactive behavior.
