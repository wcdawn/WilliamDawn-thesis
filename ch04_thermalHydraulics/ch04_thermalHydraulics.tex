\chapter{Thermal Hydraulics}
\label{ch:thermalHydraulics}

\section{Introduction}
  Material temperatures are a pivotal part of the multi-physics problem of
  simulating a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR). Temperatures are necessary for
  calculating reactor cross-sections for an accurate power distribution and can
  be used as input for a thermal hydraulic simulation. Thermal hydraulic models
  are developed for standard SFR geometry as described in
  \sref{sec:geometry_description}. Recall, the assembly is contained within a
  hexagonal can and filled with several cylindrical pins. 

  In this simulation, two thermal hydraulic models are
  employed. The first is a steady-state, one-dimensional axial convection model
  to calculate coolant temperatures and densities as the coolant flows through
  a channel. This
  model is valid for the assumption of no cross-flow between channels and 
  perfect fluid mixing within the flow channel. These assumptions are valid for
  use in simulating fast reactors with canned assemblies and assembly designs
  which encourage within-assembly mixing. Hexagonal fuel assemblies as common to
  sodium cooled fast reactors and described in \sref{sec:geometry_description}
  satisfy this assumption with canned assemblies and mixing encouraged by
  wrapping wire. The second model used is
  a radial pin-conduction model to calculate cladding, sodium bond, and fuel 
  temperatures based on the heat conduction equation.

\section{Material Properties}
  Thermodynamic properties of reactor materials are required for these models.
  The sodium properties are the most extensive with density, enthalpy, 
  thermal conductivity, dynamic viscosity, and heat capacity required. The 
  functional forms of these properties are given in 
  \cite{sodiumProp}. Additionally, thermal conductivity values are required for 
  the cladding and fuel material. Typical cladding for fast reactor designs is 
  HT9 stainless steel and a functional form of the thermal conductivity is given
  in \cite{ht9Prop}. Both sodium and steel have relatively high thermal
  conductivities and their thermal conductivities do not change significantly
  over the operating temperatures of SFRs. Therefore, the thermal conductivity
  of sodium and HT9 are assumed constant at the average value as reported in
  \cite{sodiumProp} and \cite{ht9Prop} respectively. These constant values are
  reported in \tref{tab:constant_k}.
    
  \begin{table}
    \caption{Constant Thermal Conductivity for Sodium and HT9.}
    \label{tab:constant_k}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{cl}
        \toprule
        Material & $k \units{$\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m K}}$}$ \\
        \midrule
        Sodium &  64.33 \\
        HT9    &  25.81 \\
        \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{table}

  Fuel composition is assumed to be of the form U-XZr where
  X is the weight fraction of Zr in the fuel. A typical value for X is 10\%.
  A function form of fuel thermal conductivity is given in \cite{fuelProp}.
  A plot of thermal conductivity of the fuel material as a function of
  temperature is given in \fref{fig:kfuel_plot}.
  For the expression of
  fuel thermal conductivity cited, the integral of thermal conductivity 
  is unbounded as $T \rightarrow 0$ so thermal conductivity is assumed
  constant below 300 \units{K} which is below the melting point of sodium so 
  this assumption is valid for sodium-cooled reactor applications.

\section{Power Normalization}
  Recall the multigroup neutron diffusion equation solved via the power
  iteration method returns the largest eigenvalue $\keff$ and unique positive
  eigenvector $\phi_g$ (see \sref{sec:power_iterations}). The flux calculated
  according to this method can be normalized to an arbitrary constant. For a
  specified total reactor power, $Q_{Rx}$ the normalization constant can be 
  calculated. For un-normalized neutron flux $\widetilde{\phi_{g,e}}$ with
  energy group $g$ in element $e$, the normalization constant is written as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:normalization_c}
    c = \frac{Q_{Rx}}{\sum_{g}^{G} \sum_{e}^{N_E} \kappa \Sigma_{f,g,e} \,
      \widetilde{\phi_{g,e}} \, V_e}
  \end{equation}
  where $c$ is the normalization constant and $V_e$ is the volume of element
  $e$. $\kappa$ represents the reclaimable
  (non-neutrino) energy produced per fission such that the quantity $\kappa
  \Sigma_f \phi$ represents the heat generation rate. Similar to
  $\nu\Sigma_{f,g}$, $\kappa\Sigma_{f,g}$ is calculated as an aggregate
  quantity and not simply $(\kappa)(\Sigma_{f,g}$. Then the true reactor
  neutron flux is given as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:normalization_phi}
    \phi_{g,e} = c \, \widetilde{\phi_{g,e}}
  \end{equation}
  and the power generated in each element is 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:elementpwr}
    q_{e} = \sum_g^G \kappa \Sigma_{f,e,g} \, \phi_{g,e} \, V_e .
  \end{equation}
  For an elemental power $q_e$. The quantity $q_e$ has units \units{W}. Then,
  the volumetric heat generation rate within the fuel is 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:elementqppp_fuel}
    q'''_{e} = \frac{q_e}{V_{fuel,e}}
  \end{equation}
  where $V_{fuel,e}$ is the volume of fuel in element $e$. The quantity $q'''_j$
  has units \units{$\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^3}$} will be necessary for the 
  radial conduction model.


\section{Axial Convection Model}
  \label{sec:axial_convection_model}
  In this model, the temperature and density of the coolant is calculated as
  it flows upward through a single channel as shown in
  \fref{fig:chunk_description}.

  \subsection{Geometric Model}
    Used in association with an unstructured mesh, the thermal hydraulic model
    requires mapping mesh elements to reactor assemblies. In the user input to
    the program, the user must specify to which one-dimensional flow channel 
    each element belongs.
    Adopting the nomenclature from fast reactors, each flow channel represents a
    hexagonal assembly or a ``hex''. In the following discussion, a hex index is
    subscripted $i$ for $i = 1,2,\ldots,N_{hex}$ where $N_{hex}$ is the number
    of hexagonal assemblies in a reactor. 

    The concept of ``chunks'' is also introduced to aid in the discretization of
    the thermal hydraulic model. A chunk is the set of all elements in a channel
    with a unique axial elevation. For example, in a fast reactor hexagonal
    assembly, the assembly has a unique $i$ index and contains a number of 
    chunks equal to the number of axial elevations in the simulation. 
    Additionally, each chunk is required to have unique material composition. 
    The relationship of elements, chunks, and hexes is shown in 
    \fref{fig:chunk_description}. Chunks are indexed $j = 1,2,\ldots,N_C$ where
    $N_C$ is the total number of chunks.  For $N_z$ axial elevations, 
    $N_C = N_{hex} \, N_z$. The indexing of chunks is chosen such that 
    $j+N_{hex}$ is the chunk one axial elevation above chunk $j$. The alignment
    of chunks in a one-dimensional flow channel is shown in
    \fref{fig:axial_model}.

    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{chunk_description}
      \caption{Progression of Element (left), to Chunk (center), to Hex 
        (right).}
      \label{fig:chunk_description}
    \end{figure}
    
    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{axial_model}
      \caption{One-Dimensional Axial Heat Convection Model Description.}
      \label{fig:axial_model}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{Channel Mass Flow}
    The channel mass flow $\mdot_i$ must be calculated for a user 
    specified total reactor mass flow rate $\mdot_{Rx}$.  Mass flow is 
    partitioned into each channel assuming constant mass flux at the reactor 
    inlet according to 
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:mass_flow_split}
      \mdot_i = \mdot_{Rx} \frac{A_{cool,i}N_{pin,h}}{A_{cool,Rx}}
    \end{equation}
    where $A_{cool,i}$ is the coolant flow area for channel $i$, $N_{pin,i}$ is
    the number of pins within the assembly $i$, and $A_{cool,Rx}$
    is the coolant flow area for the reactor.  That is, the mass 
    flow per unit area is assumed constant at the reactor inlet and the mass
    flow in a channel is the product of the mass flux and the channel flow area.
    This treatment is chosen to allow for assemblies with different flow areas
    or the modeling of partial assemblies in fractional core models.

  \subsection{Chunk Powers}
    For the one-dimensional heat convection model in the axial direction,
    heat generation quantities are needed for chunks. Heat generation quantities
    for elements are calculated in \eref{eq:elementpwr} and
    \eref{eq:elementqppp_fuel}.
    For the axial heat convection model, the total heat generated in a chunk,
    $q_j$, and the average volumetric heat generation rate in the fuel for
    elements within the chunk, $q'''_j$. 
    These relationships are given in \eref{eq:chunkpwr} and
    \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel} respectively. The notation $e \in j$ implies the
    summation over all elements $e$ within chunk $j$.
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:chunkpwr}
      q_j = \sum_{e \in j} q_e \\
      \label{eq:chunkqppp_fuel}
      q'''_j = \frac{\sum_{e \in j} q'''_e V_{fuel,e}}{\sum_{e \in j} 
        V_{fuel,e}}
    \end{align}
  
  \subsection{Channel Enthalpy}
    Assume all heat generated within the chunk is deposited in the coolant as it
    flows through the chunk. This occurs in steady-state operation. Then, the 
    steady-state coolant enthalpy for an axial location $z$ within the channel
    is expressed by a simple heat balance equation as
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:continuous_heat_balance}
      h_i(z) = h_{in} + \frac{1}{\mdot_i} \int_0^z q'_i(z') \; dz'
    \end{equation}
    where $h(z)$ is the specific enthalpy at axial position $z$, $h_{in}$ is the
    inlet enthalpy, $\mdot_i$ is the mass flow rate within the channel, and 
    $q'_i(x)$ is the linear heat generation rate for channel $i$ at elevation 
    $z$. $h_{in}$ is related to a user specified $T_{inlet}$ by a state 
    relationship for the coolant $h_{in} = h(T_{inlet})$.  

    The integral in \eref{eq:continuous_heat_balance} can be discretized along
    the channel and converted to a summation. In this discretization, the model
    in \fref{fig:axial_model} is used where $h_{j+1/2}$ is the enthalpy at the
    upper edge of the chunk and $h_j$ is the average enthalpy within the chunk.
    Then, the discretization of the integral \eref{eq:continuous_heat_balance}
    is 
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:heat_balance}
      h_{j+1/2} = 
        h_{in} + \frac{1}{\mdot_i} \sum_{k=1}^{N_z} q'_{i,k} \Delta z_{i,k}
    \end{equation}
    where $q'_{i,k}$ is the linear heat generation rate in the chunk located at 
    axial level $k$ in channel $i$ and $\Delta z_{i,k} = z_{i,k+1} - z_{i,k}$. 
    (Note: by indexing properly, $j = i + (k-1) \, N_{hex}$.)
    Recognizing the quantity $q_{i,k} = q'_{i,k} \Delta z_{i,k}$
    is the total heat generated in channel $i$ at axial level $i$, then 
    \eref{eq:heat_balance} can be rewritten.
    \begin{equation}
      h_{j+1/2} = h_{in} + \frac{1}{\mdot_i} \sum_{k=1}^{N_z} q_{i,k}
    \end{equation}
    The quantity $h_{j+1/2}$ represents the enthalpy in channel $i$ at the upper 
    coordinate of the one-dimensional heat convection chunk (see
    \fref{fig:axial_model}). The node-average 
    enthalpy is instead desired. To first-order approximation, then
    \begin{equation}
      h_j = \half (h_{i,k-1/2}+h_{i,k+1/2})
    \end{equation}
    where $h_j$ is the average enthalpy in chunk $j$ located in channel $i$ at
    axial level $k$.
    The final result of this model is $h_j$, the bulk coolant enthalpy in each
    chunk $j$. Given, $h_j$, the bulk coolant temperature 
    $T_{\infty,j} = T(h_j)$ can be calculated using a state relationship in
    \cite{sodiumProp}. Bulk coolant temperature will be an input into the Radial
    Conduction Model, \sref{sec:radial_conduction_model}, to later calculate
    temperatures in the fuel rod.
  
\section{Radial Conduction Model}
  \label{sec:radial_conduction_model}

  The radial heat conduction model calculates the steady-state heat
  conduction from its generation in the fuel to the coolant. This model
  represents an average fuel rod in each fuel bundle. The model explicitly
  treats fuel, sodium bond, and cladding regions. For this model, it is assumed
  that the bulk coolant temperature, $T_{\infty}$, is known within the chunk as 
  calculated in \sref{sec:axial_convection_model}. Then, the model begins by 
  calculating temperatures at key locations. Material temperature is calculated
  at the fuel center-line, fuel surface, bond surface, and clad surface. The
  derivation of these quantities are presented in \sref{sec:surface_temps}. 
  Similar results can be found in \cite{FastSpectrumReactors}.

  In the radial heat conduction model, it is assumed that all heat generated in
  the reactor is due directly to fission as described by the volumetric heat
  generation rate $q'''=\kappa \Sigma_f \phi$. However, other sources of heat
  also contribute to reactor power. Gamma radiation can account for up to 14\%
  of heat generated throughout the core. Additionally, via beta deposition and
  elastic neutron scattering, roughly 2\% of fission energy is deposited in the
  cladding material \cite{FastSpectrumReactors}.
  
  With the
  temperatures at these locations calculated, the average temperature within
  each material is calculated. These average temperatures are essential for the
  accurate simulation of the reactor as they influence multigroup constants.

  \subsection{Geometric Model}
    For the purposes of the radial model, geometry is described in
    \fref{fig:radial_model}. This model represents a cylindrical fuel pellet,
    surrounded by sodium bond, enclosed in steel cladding, with sodium coolant
    flowing in the axial direction. The center of the fuel pin is located at
    $r=0$ where $r$ is the radial coordinate. The fuel pellet has radius $R_F$
    and fuel is located in $r \in [0,R_F)$. Then, bond is located in 
    $r \in (R_F,R_B)$ and clad is located in $r \in (R_B,R_C]$. The fuel 
    center-line temperature is $T_0$ and fuel surface temperature is $T_F$. Bond
    surface temperature is $T_B$ and clad surface temperature is 
    $T_C$. $T_{\infty}$ represents the bulk coolant temperature. In this model,
    heat is generated exclusively in the fuel with volumetric heat generation 
    rate $q'''$. 

    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{radial_model}
      \caption{Geometry Description of Radial Heat Conduction Model.}
      \label{fig:radial_model}
    \end{figure}


  \subsection{Surface Temperature and Center-Line Temperatures}
    \label{sec:surface_temps}
    Temperatures at selected locations are calculated using the steady-state
    heat conduction equation with variable thermal conductivity. No restrictions
    are placed on the functional form of the materials thermal conductivities
    and the method remains general. The process of the derivation moves outward
    from the fuel center-line always assuming that the next temperature is
    known. That is, derivation begins with the fuel center-line temperature,
    assuming the fuel surface temperature is known. Then, derivation moves to
    the fuel surface temperature assuming the bond surface temperature is known.
    This pattern is terminated and the relationship is closed at the cladding
    surface where, for a given $T_{\infty}$ the clad surface temperature is
    described by Newton's law of cooling and some convective heat transfer
    correlation. For this application, the Weisman correlation is selected for
    its applicability to triangular-pitch flow channels.

    With derivation completed, the temperatures of interest are calculated.
    While derivation moved from fuel center-line outward to clad surface,
    calculation moves from clad surface inward to fuel center-line. This is
    necessary because the quantities are all unknown with the exception of
    $T_{\infty}$ so the calculation begins there. Clad surface temperature is 
    the only temperature solved explicitly as it is specified by Newton's law of
    cooling. All other temperatures are solved implicitly. In these implicit
    solutions, the value of a conductivity integral is calculated. The 
    conductivity integral is described as
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:conductivity_integral}
      K(T) = \int_0^T k(T') \; dT'
    \end{equation}
    where $k(T)$ is the thermal conductivity of the material and $K(T)$ is the
    conductivity integral. Then, for a given $K(T)$, $T$ may be calculated using
    a numerical solution method. In this application, a bisection method is 
    implemented for its robustness. A faster numerical solution method could 
    later be implemented but the bisection method was chosen for its generality
    and simplicity.

    \subsubsection{Temperature in Fuel}
      The fueled region is the only region modeled with non-zero volumetric heat
      generation. In this region, $q'''_j$ as specified by 
      \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel} is assumed constant within the fuel. 
      Additionally, the thermal conductivity in the fuel will be assumed to have
      general form $k_F(T)$. For this application, $k_F(T)$ is specified by the
      functional form in \cite{fuelProp} assuming 10\% Zr by weight included in
      fuel. For the assumed fuel composition, the thermal conductivity is
      plotted in \fref{fig:kfuel_plot}.

      The steady-state heat conduction equation with constant volumetric heat
      generation rate $q'''_j$ and variable thermal conductivity $k_F(T)$ can be
      written.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:conduction_fuel}
        \grad \cdot (k_F(T_F(r)) \grad T_F(r)) + q'''_j = 0
      \end{equation}
      Noting the gradient operator in one-dimensional cylindrical geometry,
      \eref{eq:conduction_fuel} is rewritten with partial derivatives.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:conduction_fuel_cylindrical}
        \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \, k_F(T_F(r)) \, 
          \frac{d \, T_F}{dr} \right) + q'''_j = 0
      \end{equation}
      Note the inner derivative is an ordinary derivative because the only
      function to which it applies, $T_F(r)$, is a function of one variable. The
      outer derivative is a partial derivative because it applies to $T_F(r)$ as
      well as $k_F(T_F(r))$.

      Begin solving \eref{eq:conduction_fuel_cylindrical} by multiplying the
      equation by radial coordinate $r$.
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\, k_F(T_F(r)) \, \frac{d\, T_F}{dr} 
        \right) + q'''_j = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r \in [0,r']$ where $r'$ is an arbitrary
      location $r' \in [0,R_F]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_0^{r'} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\, k_F(T_F(r)) \, 
          \frac{d\, T_F}{dr} \right) + q'''_j \right) \; dr &= 0 \\
        \int_0^{r'} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\, k_F(T_F(r)) 
          \frac{d \, T_F}{dr} \right) \; dr + \int_0^{r'} q'''_j \; dr &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:need_bc}
        \left[ r \, k_F(T_F(r)) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right]_{r=0}^{r=r'} + 
          \left. \frac{q'''_j}{2} r^2 \right|_{r=0}^{r=r'} &= 0 \\
      \end{align}
      Using a symmetry boundary condition at $r=0$, then 
      \begin{equation}
        \left. \frac{d \, T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=0} = 0
      \end{equation}
      and \eref{eq:need_bc} can be evaluated.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:dtdr_fuel}
        \left. r' k_F(T_F(r')) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_j}{2} r^{\prime 2} = 0
      \end{equation}
      Divide by the location $r'$.
      \begin{equation}
        \left. k_F(T_F(r')) \frac{d \, T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_j}{2} r' = 0
      \end{equation}
      Next, integrate $r' \in [0,r]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_0^r \left( k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} 
          + \frac{q'''_j}{2} r' \right) \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_0^r k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr' + 
          \int_0^r \frac{q'''_j}{2} r' \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_0^r k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr' + 
          \left. \frac{q'''_j}{4} r^{\prime 2} \right|_{r'=0}^{r'=r} &= 0 \\
        \int_0^r k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr' + 
          \frac{q'''_j}{4} r^2 &= 0
      \end{align}
      The fundamental theorem of calculus allows for the expression of the first
      integral.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tcl_integral}
        \int_{T_F(0)}^{T_F(r)} k_F(T_F(r)) \; dr + \frac{q'''_j}{4} r^2 = 0
      \end{equation}
      In this derivation, $k_F(T)$ is allowed to be a generic function. 
      Therefore, \eref{eq:tcl_integral} does not have a simple forward 
      expression. Solving for $T_F(0)$ will require a non-linear search such as
      the bisection method. Define the conductivity integral of the fuel
      conductivity in the form \eref{eq:conductivity_integral}.
      Then, \eref{eq:tcl_integral} can be rewritten.
      \begin{gather}
        K_F(T_F(r)) - K_F(T_F(0)) + \frac{q'''_j}{4} r^2 = 0 \\
        \label{eq:tfuel_r}
        K_F(T_F(0)) = K_F(T_F(r)) + \frac{q'''_j}{4} r^2 \\
        \label{eq:tcl_conductivity_integral}
        K_F(T_F(0)) = K_F(T_F) + \frac{q'''_j}{4} R_F^2
      \end{gather}
      The fuel center-line temperature can be calculated using
      \eref{eq:tcl_conductivity_integral} given a functional form of the
      conductivity integral $K_F(T)$ by performing a search on the function
      where $T_F(0)$ is the fuel center-line temperature, $T_F=T_F(R_F)$ is the
      fuel surface temperature, and $R_F$ is the radius of the fuel.
      If, instead, $k_F(T)$ were constant such that $k_F(T) = k_F$, then
      \eref{eq:tcl_conductivity_integral} would be equivalent to 
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:tfr}
        T_F(r) &= T_F(0) - \frac{q'''_g}{4 \overline{k_F}} r^2 \\
        \label{eq:tcl_constant_kfuel}
        T_F(0) &= T_F + \frac{q'''_j}{4 \overline{k_F}} R_F^2
      \end{align}
      where $\overline{k_F}$ is the effective thermal conductivity in the fuel
      region.
      To calculate $T_F(0)$, the fuel surface temperature must be known.
      If more information is known about $K_F(T)$, a forward expression
      may be possible. However, a bisection method is implemented to maintain
      generality.

    \subsubsection{Temperature in Sodium Bond}
      The fuel surface temperature is calculated by considering the heat
      conduction equation in the sodium bond region. There is no heat generation
      in this region so $q'''=0$.
      The steady-state heat conduction equation with no heat generation is
      written as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tc_grad}
        \grad \cdot (k_B \grad T_B(r)) = 0
      \end{equation}
      where $k_B$ is a constant representing the thermal conductivity of the
      sodium in the bond. $k_B = 64.33 \units{$\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m K}}$}$ as
      specified in \tref{tab:constant_k}.
      $T_B(r)$ is the temperature within the bond region.
      In this region, good thermal contact between the fuel and bond is
      assumed such that
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:rf_temp_continuity}
        T_F(R_F)=T_B(R_F).
      \end{equation}
      That is, the temperature is 
      continuous at the material discontinuity. Additionally, constant heat flux
      is assumed at the material discontinuity such that
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:rf_flux_continuity}
        k_F(T_F(R_F)) \left.\frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=R_F} = 
          k_B \left.\frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=R_F}.
      \end{equation}

      Recognizing one-dimensional cylindrical geometry, \eref{eq:tc_grad} can 
      be rewritten.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tb_heat_conduction}
        \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(
          r \, k_B \frac{d \, T_B}{dr} \right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Begin solving \eref{eq:tb_heat_conduction} by multiplying the equation by
      the radial coordinate $r$.
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \, k_B \frac{d \, T_B}{dr}
          \right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r \in[R_F,r']$ where $r'$ is an arbitrary
      location $r' \in [R_F,R_B]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_F}^{r'} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\, k_B \, 
          \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right) \; dr &= 0\\
        \left. r\, k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F}^{r=r'} &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:tf_first_integral}
        \left. r' \, k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} - 
          \left. R_F \, k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F} &= 0
      \end{align}
      The assumption of constant heat flux in \eref{eq:rf_flux_continuity} 
      allows for the treatment of the spatial derivative at $R_F$. Recall from
      the derivation within the fuel region, the expression \eref{eq:dtdr_fuel}
      is exploited. The expression is valid for any $r' \in [0,R_F]$ so allow
      $r'=R_F$.
      \begin{align}
        \left. R_F k_F(T_F(R_F)) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F} + 
          \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2 &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:surface_relation}
        \left. R_F k_F(T_F(R_F)) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F} &= 
          - \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2
      \end{align}
      Recall from the earlier derivation of the fuel center-line temperature 
      that the quantity $q'''_j$ is the average volumetric heat generation rate
      within chunk $j$ specified in \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel}.
      \eref{eq:surface_relation} is substituted into
      \eref{eq:tf_first_integral}.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tf_first_bc}
        \left. r' \, k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} +
          \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2 = 0
      \end{equation}
      Divide \eref{eq:tf_first_integral} by the radial coordinate $r'$. This is
      valid because $r' \ne 0$ in this region.
      \begin{equation}
        \left. k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_j}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r' \in [R_F,r]$ where $r \in [R_F,r']$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_F}^r \left( \left. k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'}
          + \frac{q'''_j}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} \right) \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_{R_F}^r \left. k_B \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \int_{R_F}^r \frac{q'''_j}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} \; dr' &= 0\\
        k_B \int_{R_F}^r \left. \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2 \left. \ln(r') \right|_{r'=R_F}^{r'=r} &= 0\\
        k_B \int_{R_F}^r \left. \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2 ( \ln(r) - \ln(R_F)) &= 0 \\
        k_B \int_{R_F}^r \left. \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2 \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) &= 0 
      \end{align}
      Again, the remaining integral can be rewritten by employing the
      fundamental theorem of calculus.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tf_fundamental_theorem}
        k_B (T_B(r) - T_B(R_F)) + \frac{q'''_j}{2} R_F^2 
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Then, solving for $T_B(R_F)$.
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:tbr}
        T_B(r) &= T_B(R_F) - \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B} R_F^2 
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) \\
        \label{eq:tf_forward}
        T_B(R_F) &= T_B(R_B) + \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B} R_F^2 
          \ln\left(\frac{R_B}{R_F}\right)
      \end{align}
      The fuel surface temperature can be calculated using
      \eref{eq:tf_forward} for constant thermal conductivity $k_B$.
      In \eref{eq:tf_forward}, the bond surface temperature must be
      given to calculate the fuel surface temperature.

    \subsubsection{Temperature in Cladding}
      Consider the heat conduction equation in the cladding region. Derivation
      of the bond surface temperature $T_B=T_B(R_B)$ is similar to
      the fuel surface temperature because both consider a heat conduction
      equation with no heat generation and constant thermal conductivity. The
      thermal conductivity in the clad is assumed constant such that $k_C(T) =
      k_C = 25.81 \units{$\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m K}}$}$ as specified in
      \tref{tab:constant_k}.
      Using the expression for temperature within the bond,
      \eref{eq:tf_forward}, the temperature within the cladding can be expressed
      similarly by changing material subscripts. 
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:tcr}
        T_C(r) &= T_C(R_B) - \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_C} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_B}\right) \\
        \label{eq:tb_forward}
        T_C(R_B) &= T_C(R_C) + \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_C} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{R_C}{R_B}\right)
      \end{align}
      The bond surface temperature can be calculated using \eref{eq:tb_forward}
      for constant thermal conductivity $k_C$. In \eref{eq:tb_forward}, the clad
      surface temperature must be given to calculate the bond surface
      temperature.

    \subsubsection{Clad Surface Temperature}
      Clad surface temperature $T_C$ is given by Newton's Law of Cooling with
      convective heat transfer coefficient $H$ specified according to the
      Weisman Correlation. Newton's Law of Cooling may be written as
      \begin{equation}
        q''_{clad} = H (T_C - T_{\infty})
      \end{equation}
      where $q''_{clad}$ is the heat flux at the clad surface $R_C$, $H$ is
      the convective heat transfer coefficient, $T_C$ is the clad surface
      temperature, and $T_{\infty}$ is the bulk coolant temperature. Using the
      relationships in \sref{sec:axial_convection_model}, $T_{\infty}$ is given
      by the state relationship $T_{\infty} = T(h_c)$ from \cite{sodiumProp}.
      The heat flux at the clad surface is related to the volumetric heat 
      generation rate in the fuel according to 
      \begin{equation}
        q''_{clad} = q'''_j \frac{R_F^2}{2 R_C}
      \end{equation}
      where $q'''_j$ is the chunk-average volumetric heat generation rate in the
      fuel according to \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel}.

      The coefficient $H$ must be calculated via an applicable correlation.
      The Weisman correlation is selected because it is valid for general fluid
      flow and has parameters correlated for triangular pitch flow areas common
      to fast reactor designs. The Weisman Correlation relates the Nusselt,
      Reynolds, and Prandlt dimensionless numbers according to
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:weisman}
        Nu = C \, Re^{0.8} \, Pr^{1/3}
      \end{equation}
      where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number, $Re$ is the Reynolds number, $Pr$ is 
      the Prandlt number, and $C$ is a correlation coefficient specified by the
      triangular geometry. For triangular pitch flow, the geometry is described
      as
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:weisman_c}
        C &= 0.026 \frac{S}{2 \, R_C} - 0.006 \\
        \label{eq:weisman_ax}
        A_x &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} S^2 - \frac{\pi R_C^2}{2} \\
        \label{eq:weisman_pw}
        P_w &= \pi R_C \\
        \label{eq:weisman_de}
        D_e &= \frac{4 \, A_x}{P_w}
      \end{align}
      where $S$ is the pin-pitch pins, $A_x$ is the
      flow cross-sectional area, $P_w$ is the flow wetted perimeter, and $D_e$
      is the effective flow diameter. The Reynolds number is defined as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:re}
        Re = \frac{\mdot_h \, D_e}{A_x \, \mu}
      \end{equation}
      where $\mdot_h$ is the assembly mass flow rate, $\mu$ is the fluid's
      dynamic viscosity given by a state relationship, and $D_e$ and $A_x$ are 
      defined according to \eref{eq:weisman_de} and \eref{eq:weisman_ax}
      respectively. The Prandtl number is defined according to 
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:pr}
        Pr = \frac{c_p \, \mu}{k}
      \end{equation}
      where $c_p$ is the fluid specific heat capacity at constant pressure, 
      $\mu$ is the fluid dynamic viscosity, and $k$ is the fluid thermal 
      conductivity. Note that each of these quantities are given by state 
      relationships. As such, the Prandtl number can itself be correlated for a
      given fluid as a state relationship.
      
      With the dimensionless quantities expressed in \eref{eq:re} and
      \eref{eq:pr}, the Weisman correlation is used to calculate the Nusselt
      number. Given a Nusselt number, the convective heat transfer coefficient
      is defined as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:hc}
        H = \frac{Nu \, k}{D_e}
      \end{equation}
      where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number from the Weisman correlation
      \eref{eq:weisman}, $k$ is the fluid thermal conductivity given by a state
      relationship, and $D_e$ is the effective flow diameter given in
      \eref{eq:weisman_de}. Finally, the clad surface temperature is expressed.
      \begin{align}
        T_C &= \frac{q''_{clad}}{H} + T_{\infty} \\
        \label{eq:tc}
        T_C &= q'''_j \frac{R_F^2}{2\,R_c\,H} + T_{\infty}
      \end{align}
      With \eref{eq:tc}, all surface temperatures and the fuel center-line
      temperature have been related to $T_{\infty}$ and the calculation of these
      quantities may begin, moving from the coolant toward the fuel center-line.

  \subsection{Average Temperatures}
    \label{sec:average_temps}
    Average material temperatures are used to evaluate material properties such
    as densities and cross-sections within the different material regions. The
    derivations in this section require the fuel center-line and surface
    temperatures from \sref{sec:surface_temps}. To calculate the average
    temperature in a region, an expression $T(r)$ is required. For the bond and
    clad regions, this is given in \eref{eq:tbr} and \eref{eq:tcr} respectively.
    No such expression exists for the fuel region due to the variable thermal
    conductivity. In the fuel region, an effective constant thermal conductivity
    is calculated. Then, $T_F(r)$ can be expressed by holding the fuel thermal
    conductivity constant at the effective value. In a test case at reactor
    conditions, this method of effective constant thermal conductivity resulted
    in a $10 \units{K}$ error in the average fuel temperature compared to a
    numerical integration with 1,000 points. For the purposes of estimating
    cross-sections in the fuel, this approximation is acceptable.


    \subsubsection{Average Fuel Temperature}
      In the fuel region, an effective constant thermal conductivity
      $\overline{k_F}$ is first calculated to satisfy
      \eref{eq:tcl_constant_kfuel} such that
      \begin{equation}
        \overline{k_F} = \frac{q'''_j \, R_F^2}{4(T_0-T_F)}
      \end{equation}
      where $T_0 = T_F(0)$ is the fuel center-line temperature and
      $T_F=T_F(R_F)$ is the fuel surface temperature.
      $T_F(0)$ and $T_F(R_F)$ have been calculated with variable thermal
      conductivity. Then, the temperature in the region, $T_F(r)$ for $r \in 
      [0,R_F]$, can be expressed as \eref{eq:tfr}. The average temperature in
      the fuel region is then
      \begin{align}
        \overline{T_F} = \frac{\int_0^{R_F} T_F(r) \, r \; dr}
          {\int_0^{R_F} r \; dr} \\
        \label{eq:tfbar_integral}
        \overline{T_F} = \frac{\int_0^{R_F} \left( T_0 - 
          \frac{q'''_j}{4 \overline{k_F}}
          r^2\right) \, r \; dr}{\int_0^{R_F} r \; dr}
      \end{align}
      noting the added $r$ multiplication term due to cylindrical coordinates.
      Begin with evaluating the integral in the denominator of
      \eref{eq:tfbar_integral}.
      \begin{align}
        \int_0^{R_F} r \; dr &= \left. \frac{r^2}{2} \right|_{r=0}^{r=R_F} \\
        \label{eq:tf_denominator}
        \int_0^{R_F} r \; dr &= \frac{R_F^2}{2}
      \end{align}
      Next, the integral in the numerator of \eref{eq:tfbar_integral} is 
      evaluated.
      \begin{align}
        \int_0^{R_F} \left( T_0 - \frac{q'''_j}{4 \overline{k_F}} r^2 \right)
          \, r \; dr&= 
          \int_0^{R_F} \left( T_0 \, r - \frac{q'''_j}{4\overline{k_F}} 
          r^3 \right) \; dr\\
        &= \left. T_0) \frac{r^2}{2} \right|_{r=0}^{r=R_F} -
          \left. \frac{q'''_j}{4 \overline{k_F}} \frac{r^4}{4} 
          \right|_{r=0}^{r=R_F} \\
        \label{eq:tf_numerator}
        &= T_0 \frac{R_F^2}{2} - \frac{q'''_j}{16 \overline{k_F}} R_F^4
      \end{align}
      Evaluating \eref{eq:tfbar_integral} by dividing \eref{eq:tf_numerator} by
      \eref{eq:tf_denominator} yields an expression for the average fuel
      temperature in the fuel region.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tf_bar}
        \overline{T_F} = T_0 - \frac{q'''_j}{8 \overline{k_F}} R_F^2
      \end{equation}
      \eref{eq:tf_bar} then yields the average temperature in the fuel region
      assuming the thermal conductivity is constant at the effective value
      $k_F$. $\overline{T_F}$ will be used to calculate fuel cross-sections. 

      More accurately, an effective fuel temperature, $\widetilde{T_F}$,
      would be used to calculate fuel cross sections. Truly, the effective
      fuel temperature for the cross-section calculation is closer to the
      surface temperature than the average temperature. Due to
      self-shielding in the fuel, the temperature corresponding to the average
      neutron flux is nearer to the surface of the fuel as neutron flux
      decreases significantly within the fuel material itself. For the purposes
      of this model, this approximation is acceptably accurate as pin powers
      cannot be resolved in this simplified geometry.

    \subsubsection{Average Bond Temperature}
      \label{sec:average_bond_temp}
      The value of the bond temperature at position $r \in [R_F,R_B]$
      is given in \eref{eq:tbr}.The average temperature within the bond,
      $\overline{T_B}$, is 
      \begin{align}
        \overline{T_B} &= \frac{\int_{R_F}^{R_B} T_B(r) \, r \; dr}
          {\int_{R_F}^{R_B} r \; dr} \\
        \label{eq:tbbar_integral}
        \overline{T_B} &= \frac{\int_{R_F}^{R_B} \left( T_F -
          \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B} R_F^2 \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) \right)
          \, r \; dr} {\int_{R_F}^{R_B} r \; dr}
      \end{align}
      with the weighting due to radial coordinates included.
      In \eref{eq:tbbar_integral}, $T_F = T_F(R_F)$ is the fuel surface
      temperature and $k_B$ is the constant thermal conductivity in the clad as
      specified in \tref{tab:constant_k}.
      Evaluating the denominator of \eref{eq:tbbar_integral}.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_F}^{R_B} r \; dr &= \left. \frac{r}{2} \right|_{r=R_F}^{r=R_B}\\
        \label{eq:tbbar_denominator}
        \int_{R_F}^{R_B} r \; dr &= \frac{R_B^2 - R_F^2}{2}
      \end{align}
      The integral in the numerator of \eref{eq:tbbar_integral} is more than a
      simple polynomial. The integral $\int \ln(r \, \alpha) \, r \; dr$ is
      given in a table of integrals. Then, the numerator of 
      \eref{eq:tbbar_integral} can be evaluated. 
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_F}^{R_B} \left( T_F - \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) \right) r \; dr 
          &= \int_{R_F}^{R_B}
          \left( T_F \, r - \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B}R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) \, r \right) \; dr \\
        &=
          \left. T_F \frac{r^2}{2} \right|_{r=R_F}^{r=R_B} - 
          \left. \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B}R_F^2 \left( \frac{r^2}{2}
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) - \frac{r^2}{4} \right)
          \right|_{r=R_F}^{r=R_B} \\
        \label{eq:tbbar_numerator}
        &= 
          T_F \frac{R_B^2-R_F^2}{2} - \frac{q'''_j}{2 k_B} R_F^2
          \left( \frac{R_F^2 - R_B^2}{4} + \frac{R_B^2}{2}
          \ln\left(\frac{R_B}{R_F}\right) \right)
      \end{align}
      With these expressions, \eref{eq:tbbar_integral} can be evaluated by 
      dividing \eref{eq:tbbar_numerator} by \eref{eq:tbbar_denominator} and 
      simplifying.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tb_bar}
        \overline{T_B} = T_F - \frac{q'''_j}{4 k_B} \, R_F^2 \, \left(
          \frac{R_F^2 - R_B^2 + 2\,R_B^2 \ln\left(\frac{R_B}{R_F}\right)}
          {R_B^2-R_F^2}\right)
      \end{equation}
      \eref{eq:tb_bar} then yields the average temperature in the fuel region
      and $\overline{T_B}$ will be used to calculate cross-sections in the bond
      region.

    \subsubsection{Average Clad Temperature}
      The calculation of the average clad temperature is similar to the
      calculation of the average bond temperature because both of these regions
      have no heat generation and are assumed to have constant thermal
      conductivity. A derivation procedure similar to
      \sref{sec:average_bond_temp} and the result will be similar. Therefore,
      the average value of the conductivity integral in the cladding is 
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tc_bar}
        \overline{T_C} = T_B - \frac{q'''}{4 k_C} R_F^2 \left(
          \frac{R_B^2 - R_C^2 + 2 \, R_C^2 \ln\left(\frac{R_C}{R_B}\right)}
          {R_C^2 - R_B^2} \right)
      \end{equation}
      where $T_B$ is the bond surface temperature. With the use of
      \eref{eq:tc_bar}, the average clad temperature $\overline{T_C}$ can be
      calculated and used for calculating cross-sections.

\section{Cross-Section Treatment}
  The purpose of calculating average material temperatures is to calculate
  cross-sections for use in the neutron diffusion equation. Cross-sections are
  calculated by interpolating between temperatures in cross-section libraries
  generated according to \sref{sec:cross_section_treatment}. A basic
  interpolation method is employed to simulate the Doppler effect and its effect
  on neutron cross-sections.

  Linear interpolation is valid for materials minimally effected by Doppler 
  broadening. Such materials include cladding and sodium as these materials do 
  not change temperature significantly over the operating range of the reactor 
  and have relatively few neutron absorption resonances. The fuel material is 
  interpolated according to a square-root interpolation because the Doppler 
  effect obeys square-root behavior. This square-root interpolation is necessary
  due to relatively high fuel temperatures and the many neutron absorption 
  resonances in fuel material, specifically Uranium.

  \subsection{Temperature Dependent Cross Section Calculation}
    Given cross-section libraries calculated analytically at selected 
    temperatures, an interpolation method can be used to calculate the 
    cross-section at a specific temperature.  The temperature interpolation is 
    unique for each material region and each region is briefly discussed.

    Reactor material temperatures are updated periodically throughout the 
    neutron diffusion calculation. The user may specify a fixed number of power
    iterations for which the diffusion calculation will run before updating the
    temperatures. Currently, 10 power iterations are run per temperature update
    and this provides efficient and convergent behavior.
    For a discussion of power iterations, see \sref{sec:power_iterations}. When
    the temperatures are updated, the cross-sections are also updated. Note that
    this update of cross-sections during a power iteration makes the iterative
    method non-linear and the convergence of the method is no longer guaranteed.
    However, this procedure is commonly used in practice and no convergence
    problems have been observed.
    Experimentally, convergence behaves acceptably for typical cases. The
    general procedure to update cross sections is given in
    \algorithmref{algorithm:temperature_update}.

    In \algorithmref{algorithm:temperature_update}, the cross-sections are
    updated using the average material temperatures. Average material
    temperatures are unique within each chunk. Therefore, instead of having
    cross-sections constant throughout the reactor and only a function of
    material, cross sections are now unique and uniquely updated within each
    chunk.

    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{Temperature and Cross-Section Update Procedure.}
      \label{algorithm:temperature_update}

          outlined in \sref{sec:average_temps}.

      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \subsubsection{Coolant Cross Sections}
      The main effect on coolant cross sections due to temperature is the change
      in the fluid density. The mass-density of the of liquid sodium (as used in
      sodium-cooled fast reactors) is given as a function of temperature
      $\rho(T)$ by a state relationship in \cite{sodiumProp}. Natural sodium is
      entirely composed of \isotope[23]{Na} and has atomic weight $M_{Na} =
      22.989769281 \units{$\frac{\text{gram}}{\text{mol}}$}$ \cite{nuclides}.
      Then, the number density of the coolant is given as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:number_density_sodium}
        N_{Na}(T) = \frac{\rho_{Na}(T) \, N_A}{M_{Na}}
      \end{equation}
      where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. When temperatures are calculated and
      cross sections are updated, the number density of sodium is updated and
      cross sections are calculated. $N_{Na}(T)$ is calculated using
      $T_{\infty,j}$ which is the bulk coolant temperature in each chunk.
      Therefore, each chunk will have a unique coolant number density.
      
      In the temperature dependent cross-section library structure described in
      \tref{tab:xstemps}, all coolant temperatures are the same. Then, the
      macroscopic cross section in the coolant for reaction $x$ is given as
      \begin{equation}
        \Sigma_{x,j} = N_{Na}(T_{\infty,j}) \; \sigma_{x,Na}
      \end{equation}
      where $N_{Na}$ is calculated according to \eref{eq:number_density_sodium}.

      If, instead, the microscopic coolant temperature was varied as a function
      of temperature, a linear interpolation is performed for $T_{i}<T<T_{i+1}$
      according to
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:cs_cool}
        \Sigma_{x,j,g} = N_{Na}(T_{\infty,j}) 
          \left( \frac{T - T_{i}}{T_{i+1}-T_{i}} 
          (\sigma_{x,Na,g,i+1} - \sigma_{x,Na,g,i})  + \sigma_{x,Na,g,i}\right)
      \end{equation}
      where $\sigma_{x,Na,g,i}$ and $\sigma_{x,Na,g,i+1}$ are the microscopic 
      cross-sections for reaction $x$ in energy group $g$ that correspond to 
      temperatures $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$ respectively.

    \subsubsection{Clad Cross Sections}
      Cross-section temperature dependence within the cladding is mostly due to
      the Doppler effect. Macroscopic cross-sections are tabulated based on the
      cross-section library data at temperatures specified in
      \tref{tab:xstemps}. The Doppler effect is typically small as cladding
      material has fewer absorption resonances than fuel material and cladding
      material does not change temperature as extremely as other reactor
      materials. Because this effect is relatively small, a simple linear
      interpolation is used to interpolate macroscopic cross sections within
      this material. For $T_i < \overline{T_{C,j}} < T_{i+1}$, the macroscopic 
      cross-section for reaction $x$ and energy group $g$ according to the 
      linear interpolation method is given as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:xs_linear_interpolation}
        \Sigma_{x,j,g} = 
          \frac{\overline{T_{C,j}} - T_{i}}{T_{i+1}-T_{i}} 
          (\Sigma_{x,g,i+1} - \Sigma_{x,g,i})  + \Sigma_{x,g,i}
      \end{equation}
      where $\Sigma_{x,g,i}$ and $\Sigma_{x,g,i+1}$ are the macroscopic
      cross-sections that correspond to temperatures $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$
      respectively. 

    \subsubsection{Bond Cross Sections}
      While the average bond temperature is computed, the temperature dependence
      of bond cross sections is neglected. This is because the bond represents a
      miniscule volume of the reactor and the sodium cross-sections within this
      region do not dictate any larger-scale reactor physics. The bond is the 
      same material as the coolant (sodium). If all coolant (sodium) 
      cross-sections are provided at the same temperature as in 
      \tref{tab:xstemps}, the bond cross sections are set to the same as the 
      coolant cross sections. If the sodium cross sections are provided at
      various temperatures, a linear interpolation is performed according to
      \eref{eq:xs_linear_interpolation}. The assumption that this region has the
      same cross-sections as the coolant has negligible effect on the solution.

    \subsubsection{Fuel Cross Sections}
      Temperature dependence of cross-sections in the fuel region is dominated
      by the Doppler effect. This effect may be large for high fuel temperatures
      and it is important that for realistic cross-sections, this effect be
      simulated properly. Macroscopic cross-sections are tabulated based on
      library data at temperatures specified in \tref{tab:xstemps}. Then, a
      square-root interpolation method is used. The square-root interpolation is
      commonly selected for cross-section interpolation because the Doppler
      effect follow square-root behavior closely. For 
      $T_i < \overline{T_{F,j}} < T_{i+1}$, the
      macroscopic cross-section for reaction $x$ in energy group $g$ within the
      fuel is calculated as
      \begin{equation}
        \Sigma_{x,j,g} = 
          \frac{\sqrt{\overline{T_{F,j}}} - \sqrt{T_{i}}}
          {\sqrt{T_{i+1}}-\sqrt{T_{i}}}
          (\Sigma_{x,g,i+1} - \Sigma_{x,g,i})  + \Sigma_{x,g,i}
      \end{equation}
      where $\Sigma_{x,g,i}$ and $\Sigma_{x,g,i+1}$ are the macroscopic
      cross-sections of reaction $x$ corresponding to $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$
      respectively. Additionally, $T_i$ is in absolute units of temperature
      (Kelvin).
      
\section{Thermal Hydraulic Results}
  To demonstrate the expected behavior of these models, axial and radial
  temperature plots are generated. The radial solution is only generated to
  demonstrate the expected behavior as the radial temperature functions
  themselves are not used in the reactor simulation. The axial solution comes
  from a typical reactor simulation and demonstrates the expected behaviors for
  system temperatures.

  \subsection{Radial Results}
    Radial temperatures for a single-pin model are shown in
    \fref{fig:radial_temp_plot}. This model was generated for 
    ${q'''_j = 6.93 \times 10^9 \units{$\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^3}$}}$ and 
    $\mdot_i = 11.42 \units{$\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}$}$ which are typical 
    values generated by conducting a full reactor simulation. It is seen
    that the temperature profile within the fuel region is approximately 
    quadratic and temperature profiles in the bond and clad are approximately
    linear. These are the expected behavior for a constant thermal conductivity
    in each region. Additionally, it is seen that the average temperatures as
    calculated above reasonably approximate the average temperature within each
    material. For this case, it was observed that a numeric integration method
    using 1,000 points to calculate the average temperature and the calculation
    method described in \sref{sec:average_temps} agreed to within 
    $10 \units{K}$.

  \subsection{Axial Results}
    Axial temperatures for a single assembly are shown in
    \fref{fig:axial_temp_plot}. This plot was generated by solving the neutron
    diffusion problem for a typical reactor to estimate a heat generation
    profile. Then, the temperatures were calculated at each level.
    \fref{fig:axial_temp_plot} contains average material temperatures used in
    the calculations of cross sections for the example reactor simulation. These
    temperatures were output by the code itself.
