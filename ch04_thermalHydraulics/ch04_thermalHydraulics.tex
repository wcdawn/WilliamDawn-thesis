\section{Introduction}
  For reactor design purposes, designs are ultimately constrained by thermal
  properties. Additionally, neutronics properties in the form of cross-sections
  and density changes are significantly affected by system temperatures.
  Therefore, to accurately simulate the neutron distribution within the reactor,
  it is necessary to also simulate temperatures within the reactor.

  In this simulation, two thermal hydraulic models are
  employed. The first is a one-dimensional fluid flow model to calculate coolant
  temperatures as the coolant flows through a channel. This model is valid for
  the assumption of no cross-flow between channels and perfect fluid mixing 
  within the flow channel. For use in simulating fast reactors with canned
  assemblies and assembly designs which encourage mixing, these assumptions are
  valid. The second model used is a radial
  pin-conduction model to calculate cladding, sodium bond, and fuel temperatures
  based on the heat conduction equation.

  Thermodynamic properties of reactor materials are required for these models.
  The sodium properties required are the most extensive with density, enthalpy, 
  thermal conductivity, dynamic viscosity, and heat capacity required. The 
  functional forms of these properties in this application are given in 
  \cite{sodiumProp}. Additionally, thermal conductivity values are required for 
  cladding and fuel material. Typical cladding for fast reactor designs is HT9
  stainless steel and a functional form of the conductivity is given in
  \cite{ht9Prop}. Fuel composition is assumed to be of the form U-XZr where
  X is the weight fraction of Zr in the fuel. A typical value for X is 10\%.
  Fuel thermal conductivity is given in \cite{fuelProp}. For the expression of
  fuel thermal conductivity given, the integral of thermal conductivity 
  is unbounded as $T \rightarrow 0$ so thermal conductivity is assumed
  constant below 300 K which is below the melting point of sodium so this
  assumption is valid for reactor applications.

\section{Geometric Description}
  For the purposes of the thermal hydraulics model, geometry is described in
  \fref{fig:radial_model}. This model represents a cylindrical fuel pellet,
  surrounded by sodium bond, enclosed in steel cladding, with sodium coolant
  flowing in the axial direction. The center of the fuel pin is located at
  $r=0$ where $r$ is the radial coordinate. The fuel pellet has radius $R_F$ and
  fuel is located in $r \in [0,R_F)$. Then, bond is located in $r \in (R_F,R_B)$
  and clad is located in $r \in (R_B,R_C]$. The fuel center-line temperature is
  $T_0$ and fuel surface temperature is $T_F$. Bond surface temperature is
  $T_B$ and clad surface temperature is $T_C$. $T_{\infty}$ represents the bulk
  coolant temperature. In this model, heat is generated exclusively in the fuel
  with volumetric heat generation rate $q'''$. 

  In a cross-sectional assembly view, dimensions are presented in
  \fref{fig:pin_model} and \fref{fig:hex_can}. In \fref{fig:hex_can}, $Th_{Box}$
  is the thickness of the assembly box, F2F is the flat-to-flat measurement of
  the outside of the hexagonal can, and Pitch is the distance between the
  center of two pins. In future notation, the quantity ``Pitch'' is also noted
  $S$. Using the geometry described in these figures, the material
  cross-sectional areas are calculated according to the given formulae where
  $N_{pin}$ is the number of pins in the assembly.
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:afrac_first}
    A_{total} &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} F2F^2 \\
    A_{can} &= A_{total} - 
      \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \left(  F2F - 2 \, Th_{Box} \right) \\
    A_{wrap} &= N_{pin} \frac{\pi}{4} D_{wrap}^2 \\
    A_{clad} &= N_{pin} \pi (R_C^2 - R_B^2) \\
    A_{bond} &= N_{pin} \pi (R_B^2 - R_F^2) \\
    A_{fuel} &= N_{pin} \pi R_F^2 \\
    \label{eq:afrac_last}
    A_{cool} &= A_{total} - A_{can} - A_{wrap} - A_{clad} - A_{bond} - A_{fuel}
  \end{align}
  Calculating the areas as above allows for calculation of cross-sectional area
  fractions. Assuming constant dimensions within an element in the axial
  direction, these area fractions are equivalent to volume fractions and are
  useful for neutron cross-section calculations. Additionally, these formulae
  allow for thermal expansion calculations as the liquid sodium in the bond and
  the coolant are allowed to vary to allow for the expansion of other materials.

  Used in association with an unstructured mesh, the thermal hydraulic model
  requires mapping mesh elements to flow channels. For the model described here,
  a flow channel is a single fuel assembly. In the user input to the
  program, the user must specify to which one-dimensional flow channel belongs.
  Adopting the nomenclature from fast reactors, each flow channel represents a
  hexagonal-assembly or a ``hex''. In the following discussion, a hex index is
  subscripted $h$ for $h = 1,2,\ldots,N_h$ where $N_h$ is the number of
  hexagonal assemblies in a reactor. Though the term ``hex'' is used, there is
  no assumption made in any of the calculations that the assembly is indeed
  hexagonal. Square one-dimensional assemblies would be simulated similarly.

  The concept of ``chunks'' is also introduced to aid in the discretization of
  the thermal hydraulic model. A chunk is the set of all elements in a channel
  with a unique axial elevation. For example, in a fast reactor hexagonal
  assembly, the assembly has a unique $h$ index and contains a number of chunks
  equal to the number of axial elevations in the simulation. Additionally, each 
  chunk is required to have unique material composition. The concept of chunks
  is shown in \fref{fig:chunk_description}.  Chunks are indexed
  $c = 1,2,\ldots,N_c$ where $N_c$ is the total number of chunks. For $N_z$
  axial elevations, $N_c = N_h \, N_z$. The indexing
  of chunks is chosen such that $c+N_h$ is the chunk one axial elevation above
  chunk $c$.

\section{Power Calculation}
  Recall the multigroup neutron diffusion equation solved via the power
  iteration method returns the largest eigenvalue $\keff$ and unique positive
  eigenvector $\phi_g$ (see \sref{sec:power_iterations}). The flux calculated
  according to this method can be normalized to an arbitrary constant. For a
  specified total reactor power, $Q_{Rx}$ the normalization constant can be 
  calculated. For un-normalized neutron flux $\widetilde{\phi_{g,e}}$ with group
  $g$ in element $e$, the normalization constant is written as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:normalization_c}
    c = \frac{Q_{Rx}}{\sum_{g}^{G} \sum_{e}^{N_E} \kappa \Sigma_{f,g,e} \,
      \widetilde{\phi_{g,e}}}
  \end{equation}
  where $c$ is the normalization constant. $\kappa$ represents the reclaimable
  (non-neutrino) energy produced per fission such that the quantity $\kappa
  \Sigma_f \phi$ represents the heat generation rate. Then the true reactor
  neutron flux is given as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:normalization_phi}
    \phi_{g,e} = c \, \widetilde{\phi_{g,e}}
  \end{equation}
  and the power distribution is 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:elementpwr}
    q_{e} = \sum_g^G \kappa \Sigma_{f,e,g} \phi_{g,e}.
  \end{equation}
  For an elemental power $q_e$, then the volumetric heat generation rate within
  the fuel is 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:elementqppp_fuel}
    q'''_{e} = \frac{q_e}{V_{fuel,e}}
  \end{equation}
  where $V_{fuel,e}$ is the volume of fuel in element $e$. This will be
  necessary for the radial conduction model.

  For the one-dimensional heat convection model in the axial direction,
  heat generation quantities are needed for chunks instead of elements.
  The quantities required are then the total heat generated in a chunk $q_c$ and
  the average volumetric heat generation rate in the fuel for elements within
  the chunk $q'''_c$. These relationships are given in \eref{eq:chunkpwr} and
  \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel} respectively. The notation $e \in c$ implies the
  summation over all elements $e$ within chunk $c$.
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:chunkpwr}
    q_c = \sum_{e \in c} q_e \\
    \label{eq:chunkqppp_fuel}
    q'''_c = \frac{\sum_{e \in c} q'''_e V_{fuel,e}}{\sum_{e \in c} V_{fuel,e}}
  \end{align}

\section{Axial Convection Model}
  \label{sec:axial_convection_model}
  First, the channel mass flow $\mdot_h$ must be calculated for a user specified
  total reactor mass flow rate $\mdot_{Rx}$.  Mass flow is partitioned into each
  channel assuming constant mass flux at the reactor inlet according to 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mass_flow_split}
    \mdot_h = \mdot_{Rx} \frac{A_{cool,h}}{A_{cool,Rx}}
  \end{equation}
  where $A_{cool,h}$ is the coolant flow area for channel $h$ and $A_{cool,Rx}$
  is the coolant flow area for the reactor.  That is, the mass 
  flow per unit area is assumed constant at the reactor inlet and the mass flow 
  in a channel is the product of the mass flux and the channel flow area. 
  
  The coolant enthalpy for an axial location $z$ within the channel is expressed
  by a simple heat balance equation as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:continuous_heat_balance}
    h_h(x) = h_{in} + \frac{1}{\mdot_h} \int_0^z q'_h(z') \; dz'
  \end{equation}
  where $h$ is the specific enthalpy, $h_{in}$ is the inlet enthalpy, $\mdot_h$
  is the mass flow rate within the channel, and $q'_h(x)$ is the linear heat 
  generation rate for channel $h$ at elevation $z$. $h_{in}$ is related to a
  user specified 
  $T_{inlet}$ by a state relationship for the coolant $h_{in} = h(T_{inlet})$.
  The integral in \eref{eq:continuous_heat_balance} can be discretized along the
  channel and converted to a summation.
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:heat_balance}
    \widetilde{h_c} = 
      h_{in} + \frac{1}{\mdot_h} \sum_{i}^{N_z} q'_{i,h} \Delta z_{i,h}
  \end{equation}
  where $q'_{i,h}$ is the linear heat generation rate in the chunk located at 
  axial level $i$ in 
  channel $h$ and $\Delta z_{i,h} = z_{i+1,h} - z_{i,h}$. (Note: by indexing
  properly, $c = h + (i-1) \, N_h$.) Recognizing the 
  quantity $q'_{i,h} \Delta z_{i,h}$ is the total heat generated in channel $h$ 
  at axial level $h$, then \eref{eq:heat_balance} can be rewritten.
  \begin{equation}
    \widetilde{h_c} = h_{in} + \frac{1}{\mdot_h} \sum_i^{N_z} q_{i,h}
  \end{equation}
  The quantity $\widetilde{h_c}$ represents the enthalpy in channel $h$ at axial
  elevation $z_i$. Note that $z_i$ is the upper coordinate of the
  one-dimensional heat convection node. The node-average enthalpy is instead
  desired. To first-order approximation, then
  \begin{equation}
    h_c = \half (\widetilde{h_{i-1,h}} + \widetilde{h_{i,h}})
  \end{equation}
  where $h_c$ is the average enthalpy in chunk $c$ located in channel $h$ at
  axial level $i$.
  The final result of this model is $h_c$, the bulk coolant enthalpy in each
  chunk $c$. Given, $h_c$, bulk coolant temperature $T_{\infty,c} = T(h_c)$ can
  be calculated using a state relationship. This will be an input into the 
  Radial Conduction Model, \sref{sec:radial_conduction_model}, to later 
  calculate the average material temperatures.
  
\section{Radial Conduction Model}
  \label{sec:radial_conduction_model}
  The radial heat conduction model is intended to describe the steady-state heat
  conduction from its generation in the fuel to the coolant. A pin model as
  described in \fref{fig:radial_model} is assumed with explicit treatment of
  fuel, sodium bond, and cladding regions. For this model, it is assumed that
  $T_{\infty}$ is known within the chunk as calculated in
  \sref{sec:axial_convection_model}. Then, the model begins by calculating
  temperatures at key locations. Material temperature is calculated at the fuel
  center-line, fuel surface, bond surface, and clad surface. The derivation of
  these quantities are presented in \sref{sec:surface_temps}. With the
  temperatures at these locations calculated, the average temperature within
  each material is calculated. These average temperatures are essential for the
  accurate simulation of the reactor as they influence multigroup constants. The
  calculation of the average temperatures are presented in
  \sref{sec:average_temps}.

  \subsection{Surface Temperature and Center-Line Temperatures}
    \label{sec:surface_temps}
    Temperatures at selected locations are calculated using the steady-state
    heat conduction equation with variable thermal conductivity. No restrictions
    are placed on the functional form of the materials thermal conductivities
    and the method remains general. The process of the derivation moves outward
    from the fuel center-line always assuming that the next temperature is
    known. That is, derivation begins with the fuel center-line temperature,
    assuming the fuel surface temperature is known. Then, derivation moves to
    the fuel surface temperature assuming the bond surface temperature is known.
    This pattern is terminated and the relationship is closed at the cladding
    surface where, for a given $T_{\infty}$ the clad surface temperature is
    described by Newton's law of cooling and some convective heat transfer
    correlation. For this application, the Weisman correlation is selected for
    its applicability to triangular-pitch flow channels.

    With derivation completed, the temperatures of interest are calculated.
    While derivation moved from fuel center-line outward to clad surface,
    calculation moves from clad surface inward to fuel center-line. This is
    necessary because the quantities are all unknown with the exception of
    $T_{\infty}$ so the calculation begins there. Clad temperature is the only
    temperature solved explicitly as it is specified by Newton's law of cooling.
    All other temperatures are solved implicitly. In these implicit solutions,
    the value of a conductivity is calculated. The conductivity integral is
    described as
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:conductivity_integral}
      K(T) = \int_0^T k(T') \; dT'
    \end{equation}
    where $k(T)$ is the thermal conductivity of the material. Then, for a given
    $K(T)$, $T$ may be calculated using a numerical solution method. In this
    application, a bisection method is implemented for its robustness. A faster
    numerical solution method could later be implemented but the bisection
    method was chosen for its generality and simplicity.

    \subsubsection{Fuel Center-Line Temperature}
      The fueled region is the only region modeled with non-zero volumetric heat
      generation. In this region, $q'''_c$ as specified by 
      \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel} is assumed constant within the fuel. 
      Additionally, the thermal conductivity in the fuel will be assumed to have
      general form $k_F(T)$. For this application, $k_F(T)$ is specified by the
      functional form in \cite{fuelProp} assuming 10\% Zr by weight included in
      fuel.

      The steady-state heat conduction equation with constant volumetric heat
      generation rate $q'''_c$ and variable thermal conductivity $k_F(T)$ can be
      written.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:conduction_fuel}
        \grad \cdot (k_F(T) \grad T_F(r)) + q'''_c = 0
      \end{equation}
      Noting the gradient operator in cylindrical geometry,
      \eref{eq:conduction_fuel} is rewritten with partial derivatives.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:conduction_fuel_cylindrical}
        \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \, k_F(T) \, 
          \frac{d \, T_F}{dr} \right) + q'''_c = 0
      \end{equation}
      Note the inner derivative is an ordinary derivative because the only
      function to which it applies, $T_F(r)$, is a function of one variable. The
      outer derivative is a partial derivative because it applies to $T_F(r)$ as
      well as $k_F(T) = k_F(T_F(r))$.

      Begin solving \eref{eq:conduction_fuel_cylindrical} by multiplying the
      equation by radial coordinate $r$.
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( k_F(T_F(r)) \, \frac{d\, T_F}{dr} 
        \right) + q'''_c = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r \in [0,r']$ where $r'$ is an arbitrary
      location $r' \in [0,R_F]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_0^{r'} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( k_F(T_F(r)) \, 
          \frac{d\, T_F}{dr} \right) + q'''_c \right) \; dr &= 0 \\
        \int_0^{r'} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( k_F(T_F(r)) 
          \frac{d \, T_F}{dr} \right) \; dr + \int_0^{r'} q'''_c \; dr &= 0 \\
        \left. r \, k_F(T_F(r)) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=0}^{r=r'} + 
          \left. \frac{q'''_c}{2} r^2 \right|_{r=0}^{r=r'} &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:dtdr_fuel}
        \left. r' k_F(T_F(r')) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} r^{\prime 2} &= 0
      \end{align}
      Divide by the location $r'$.
      \begin{equation}
        \left. k_F(T_F(r')) \frac{d \, T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} r' = 0
      \end{equation}
      Next, integrate $r' \in [0,r]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_0^r \left( k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} 
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} r' \right) \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_0^r k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr' + 
          \int_0^r \frac{q'''_c}{2} r' \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_0^r k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr' + 
          \left. \frac{q'''_c}{4} r^{\prime 2} \right|_{r'=0}^{r'=r} &= 0 \\
        \int_0^r k_F(T_F(r')) \left. \frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr' + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{4} r^2 &= 0
      \end{align}
      The fundamental theorem of calculus allows for the expression of the first
      integral.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tcl_integral}
        \int_{T_F(0)}^{T_F(r)} k_F(T_F(r)) \; dr + \frac{q'''_c}{4} r^2 = 0
      \end{equation}
      In this derivation, $k_F(T)$ is allowed to be a generic function. 
      Therefore, \eref{eq:tcl_integral} does not have a simple forward 
      expression. Solving for $T_F(0)$ will require a non-linear search such as
      the bisection method. Define the conductivity integral of the fuel
      conductivity in the form \eref{eq:conductivity_integral}.
      Then, \eref{eq:tcl_integral} can be rewritten.
      \begin{gather}
        K_F(T_F(r)) - K_F(T_F(0)) + \frac{q'''_c}{4} r^2 = 0 \\
        K_F(T_F(0)) = K_F(T_F(r)) + \frac{q'''_c}{4} r^2 \\
        \label{eq:tcl_conductivity_integral}
        K_F(T_F(0)) = K_F(T_F) + \frac{q'''_c}{4} R_F^2
      \end{gather}
      The fuel center-line temperature can be calculated using
      \eref{eq:tcl_conductivity_integral} given a functional form of the
      conductivity integral $K_F(T)$ by performing a search on the function
      where $T_F(0)$ is the fuel center-line temperature, $T_F=T_F(R_F)$ is the
      fuel surface temperature, and $R_F$ is the radius of the fuel. To
      calculate $T_F(0)$, the fuel surface temperature must be known.
      If more information is known about $K_F(T)$, a forward expression
      may be possible. However, a bisection method is implemented to maintain
      generality.

    \subsubsection{Fuel Surface Temperature}
      The fuel surface temperature is calculated by considering the heat
      conduction equation in the sodium bond region. There is no heat generation
      in this region so $q'''=0$.
      The steady-state heat conduction equation with no heat generation is
      written as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tc_grad}
        \grad \cdot (k_B(T_B(r)) \grad T_B(r)) = 0
      \end{equation}
      where $k_B(T)$ is a general expression for the thermal conductivity in the
      sodium bond and is given by a state relationship in \cite{sodiumProp}.
      $T_B(r)$ is the temperature within the cladding region.
      In this region, good thermal contact is
      assumed such that $T_F(R_F)=T_B(R_F)$. That is, the temperature is 
      continuous at the material discontinuity. Additionally, constant heat flux
      is assumed at the material discontinuity such that $k_F(T_F(R_F))
      \left.\frac{d\,T_F}{dr}\right|_{r=R_F} = k_B(T_B(R_F))
      \left.\frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=R_F}$.

      Recognizing cylindrical geometry, \eref{eq:tc_grad} can be rewritten.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tb_heat_conduction}
        \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(
          r \, k_B(T_B(r)) \frac{d \, T_B}{dr} \right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Begin solving \eref{eq:tb_heat_conduction} by multiplying the equation by
      the radial coordinate $r$.
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \, k_B(T_B(r)) \frac{d \, T_B}{dr}
          \right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r \in[R_F,r']$ where $r'$ is an arbitrary
      location $r' \in [R_F,R_B]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_F}^{r'} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\, k_B(T_B(r)) \, 
          \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right) \; dr &= 0\\
        \left. r\, k_B(T_B(r)) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F}^{r=r'} &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:tf_first_integral}
        \left. r' \, k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} - 
          \left. R_F \, k_B(T_B(R_F)) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F} &= 0
      \end{align}
      The assumption of constant heat flux allows for the treatment of the
      spatial derivative at $R_F$. Recall from the derivation within the fuel
      region, the expression \eref{eq:dtdr_fuel} is exploited. The expression is
      valid for any $r' \in [0,R_F]$ so allow $r'=R_F$.
      \begin{align}
        \left. R_F k_F(T_F(R_F)) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F} + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:surface_relation}
        \left. R_F k_F(T_F(R_F)) \frac{d\,T_F}{dr} \right|_{r=R_F} &= 
          - \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2
      \end{align}
      Recall from the earlier derivation that the quantity $q'''_c$ is the
      average volumetric heat generation rate within chunk $c$.
      \eref{eq:surface_relation} is substituted into
      \eref{eq:tf_first_integral}.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tf_first_bc}
        \left. r' \, k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} +
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 = 0
      \end{equation}
      Divide \eref{eq:tf_first_integral} by the radial coordinate $r'$. This is
      valid because $r \ne 0$ in this region.
      \begin{equation}
        \left. k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r' \in [R_F,r]$ where $r \in [R_F,r']$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_F}^r \left( \left. k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'}
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} \right) \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_{R_F}^r \left. k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \int_{R_F}^r \frac{q'''_c}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} \; dr' &= 0\\
        \int_{R_F}^r \left. k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 \left. \ln(r') \right|_{r'=R_F}^{r'=r} &= 0\\
        \int_{R_F}^r \left. k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 ( \ln(r) - \ln(R_F)) &= 0 \\
        \int_{R_F}^r \left. k_B(T_B(r')) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) &= 0 
      \end{align}
      Again, the remaining integral can be rewritten by employing the
      fundamental theorem of calculus.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tf_fundamental_theorem}
        \int_{T_B(R_F)}^{T(r)} k_B(T_B(r)) \; dT + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Defining a conductivity integral function $K_B(T)$ similar to
      \eref{eq:conductivity_integral}, \eref{eq:tf_fundamental_theorem} can be
      rewritten.
      \begin{gather}
        K_B(T_B(r)) - K_B(T_B(R_F)) + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) = 0 \\
        K_B(T_B(R_F)) = K_B(T_C(r)) + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_F}\right) \\
        \label{eq:tf_conductivity_integral}
        K_B(T_F) = K_B(T_B) + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{R_B}{R_F}\right)
      \end{gather}
      The fuel surface temperature can be calculated using
      \eref{eq:tf_conductivity_integral} given a functional form of the
      conductivity integral $K_B(T)$ by performing a search on the function. In
      \eref{eq:tf_conductivity_integral}, $T_F=T_B(R_F)$ is the fuel surface 
      temperature, $T_B=T_B(R_B)$ is the bond surface temperature and must be
      given to use this expression.

    \subsubsection{Bond Surface Temperature}
      Consider the heat conduction equation in the cladding region. Derivation
      of the bond surface temperature $T_B=T_B(R_B)$ is similar to
      the fuel surface temperature because both consider a heat conduction
      equation with no heat generation. The steady-state heat conduction 
      equation for this region is written as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:clad_conduction_grad}
        \grad \cdot (k_C(T_C(r)) \grad T_C(r)) = 0
      \end{equation}
      where $k_C(T)$ is a functional form of the thermal conductivity in the
      cladding from \cite{ht9Prop}. $T_C(r)$ is the temperature within the
      cladding region and $T_C=T_C(R_C)$ is the cladding surface temperature. 
      In this region, good thermal contact is assumed such that
      $T_B(R_B)=T_C(R_B)$. Additionally, constant heat flux is assumed at the
      cladding-bond boundary such that $\left. k_B(T_B(R_C))
      \frac{d\,T_B}{dr}\right|_{r=R_C} = \left. k_C(T_C(R_C))
      \frac{d\,T_C}{dr}\right|_{r=R_F}$.

      Rewriting the gradient for cylindrical geometry,
      \eref{eq:clad_conduction_grad}.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:clad_conduction}
        \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\, k_C(T_C(r)) 
          \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Begin solving \eref{eq:clad_conduction} by multiplying the equation by the
      radial coordinate $r$.
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\,k_C(T_C(r))\,\frac{d\,T_C}{dr}
          \right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation through $r \in [R_B,r']$ where $r'$ is an arbitrary
      coordinate $r' \in [R_B,R_C]$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_B}^{r'} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \, k_C(T_C(r))
          \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right) \; dr &= 0 \\
        \left. r\,k_C(T_C(r)) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=R_B}^{r=r'} &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:clad_before}
        \left. r' \, k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} - 
          \left. R_B \, k_C(T_C(R_B)) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=R_B} &= 0
      \end{align}
      The assumption of constant heat flux at the material discontinuity at
      $R_B$ allows for an expression of the derivative at $R_B$. Recall from the
      derivation within the bond region, the expression \eref{eq:tf_first_bc}
      can be used. The expression is valid for any $r' \in [R_F,R_B]$ so allow
      $r'=R_B$.
      \begin{align}
        \left. R_B \, k_B(T_B(R_B)) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=R_B} +
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:clad_bc_relation}
        \left. R_B \, k_B(T_B(R_B)) \frac{d\,T_B}{dr} \right|_{r=R_B} &= 
          - \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2
      \end{align}
      Recalling again that $q'''_c$ is the average volumetric heat generation
      rate in the fuel within chunk $c$. \eref{eq:clad_bc_relation} is
      inserted into \eref{eq:clad_before}.
      \begin{equation}
        \left. r' \, k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 = 0
      \end{equation}
      Divide by $r'$ because $r' \ne 0$ in this region.
      \begin{equation}
        \left. k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} + 
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} = 0
      \end{equation}
      Integrate the equation for $r' \in [R_B,r]$ where $r \in [R_B,r']$.
      \begin{align}
        \int_{R_B}^r \left( \left. k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'}
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} \right) \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_{R_B}^r \left. k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \int_{R_B}^r \frac{q'''_c}{2} \frac{R_F^2}{r'} \; dr' &= 0 \\
        \int_{R_B}^r \left. k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 \left. \ln(r') \right|_{r'=R_B}^{r'=r} &= 0\\
        \int_{R_B}^r \left. k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 (\ln(r) - \ln(R_B)) &= 0\\
        \int_{R_B}^r \left. k_C(T_C(r')) \frac{d\,T_C}{dr} \right|_{r=r'} \; dr'
          + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_B}\right) &= 0
      \end{align}
      Again, the integral term can be rewritten with use of the fundamental
      theorem of calculus.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:clad_integral}
        \int_{T_C(R_B)}^{T_C(r)} k_C(T_C(r)) \; dr +
          \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2 \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_B}\right) = 0
      \end{equation}
      Defining a conductivity integral function $K_C(T)$ similar to
      \eref{eq:conductivity_integral}, \eref{eq:clad_integral} can be rewritten.
      \begin{gather}
        K_C(T_C(r)) - K_C(T_C(R_B)) + \frac{q'''_C}{2} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_B}\right) = 0 \\
        K_C(T_C(R_B)) = K_C(T_C(r)) + \frac{q'''_c}{2} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{r}{R_B}\right) \\
        \label{eq:ktb}
        K_C(T_B) = K_C(T_C) + \frac{q'''_C}{2} R_F^2
          \ln\left(\frac{R_C}{R_B}\right) 
      \end{gather}
      The bond surface temperature can be calculated using \eref{eq:ktb} given a
      function describing the cladding conductivity integral $K_C(T)$ and
      performing a bisection method search on the function. In \eref{eq:ktb},
      $T_B = T_C(R_B)$ is the bond surface temperature, $T_C=T_C(R_C)$ is the
      clad surface temperature and is calculated using a different method and
      treated as an input to this method.  

    \subsubsection{Clad Surface Temperature}
      Clad surface temperature $T_C$ is given by Newton's Law of Cooling with
      convective heat transfer coefficient $h_c$ specified according to the
      Weisman Correlation. Newton's Law of Cooling may be written as
      \begin{equation}
        q''_{clad} = h_c (T_C - T_{\infty})
      \end{equation}
      where $q''_{clad}$ is the heat flux at the clad surface $R_C$, $h_c$ is
      the convective heat transfer coefficient, $T_C$ is the clad surface
      temperature, and $T_{\infty}$ is the bulk coolant temperature. Using the
      relationships in \sref{sec:axial_convection_model}, $T_{\infty}$ is given
      by the state relationship $T_{\infty} = T(h_c)$. The heat flux at the clad
      surface is related to the volumetric heat generation rate in the fuel
      according to 
      \begin{equation}
        q''_{clad} = q'''_c \frac{R_F^2}{2 R_C}
      \end{equation}
      where $q'''_c$ is the chunk-average volumetric heat generation rate in the
      fuel according to \eref{eq:chunkqppp_fuel}.

      The coefficient $h_c$ must be calculated via an applicable correlation.
      The Weisman correlation is selected because it is valid for general fluid
      flow and has parameters correlated for triangular pitch flow areas common
      to fast reactor designs. The Weisman Correlation relates the Nusselt,
      Reynolds, and Prandlt dimensionless numbers according to
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:weisman}
        Nu = C \, Re^{0.8} \, Pr^{1/3}
      \end{equation}
      where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number, $Re$ is the Reynolds number, $Pr$ is 
      the Prandlt number, and $C$ is a correlation coefficient specified by the
      triangular geometry. For triangular pitch flow, the geometry is described
      as
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:weisman_c}
        C &= 0.026 \frac{S}{2 \, R_C} - 0.006 \\
        \label{eq:weisman_ax}
        A_x &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} S^2 - \frac{\pi R_C^2}{2} \\
        \label{eq:weisman_pw}
        P_w &= \pi R_C \\
        \label{eq:weisman_de}
        D_e &= \frac{4 \, A_x}{P_w}
      \end{align}
      where $S$ is the pitch between pins (see \fref{fig:hex_can}), $A_x$ is the
      flow cross-sectional area, $P_w$ is the flow wetted perimeter, and $D_e$
      is the effective flow diameter. The Reynolds number is defined as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:re}
        Re = \frac{\mdot_h \, D_e}{A_x \, \mu}
      \end{equation}
      where $\mdot_h$ is the assembly mass flow rate, $\mu$ is the fluid's
      dynamic viscosity given by a state relationship, and $D_e$ and $A_x$ are 
      defined according to \eref{eq:weisman_de} and \eref{eq:weisman_ax}
      respectively. The Prandtl number is defined according to 
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:pr}
        Pr = \frac{c_p \, \mu}{k}
      \end{equation}
      where $c_p$ is the fluid specific heat capacity at constant pressure, 
      $\mu$ is the fluid dynamic viscosity, and $k$ is the fluid thermal 
      conductivity. Note that each of these quantities are given by state 
      relationships. As such, the Prandtl number can itself be correlated for a
      given fluid as a state relationship.
      
      With the dimensionless quantities expressed in \eref{eq:re} and
      \eref{eq:pr}, the Weisman correlation is used to calculate the Nusselt
      number. Given a Nusselt number, the convective heat transfer coefficient
      is defined as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:hc}
        h_c = \frac{Nu \, k}{D_e}
      \end{equation}
      where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number from the Weisman correlation
      \eref{eq:weisman}, $k$ is the fluid thermal conductivity given by a state
      relationship, and $D_e$ is the effective flow diameter given in
      \eref{eq:weisman_de}. Finally, the clad surface temperature is expressed.
      \begin{align}
        T_C &= \frac{q''_{clad}}{h_c} + T_{\infty} \\
        \label{eq:tc}
        T_C &= q'''_c \frac{R_F^2}{2\,R_c\,h_c} + T_{\infty}
      \end{align}
      With \eref{eq:tc}, all surface temperatures and the fuel center-line
      temperature have been related to $T_{\infty}$ and the calculation of these
      quantities may begin, moving from the coolant toward the fuel center-line.

  \subsection{Average Temperatures}
    \label{sec:average_temps}

\section{Cross Section Treatment}
  \subsection{Cross Section Library Generation}
    State-of-the-art fast reactor simulations utilize cross-sections generated
    from \mcc. This code from Argonne National Laboratory allows for the
    generation of mulitgroup constants useful for solution of the neutron
    diffusion equation. The calculation in \mcc begins with a 2,082 fine-group
    neutron library based on ENDF-VII data and can be collapsed to an
    arbitrary, user-specified, energy group structure. For this application, the
    recommended and default 33-group structure is used. In fissile media, the
    energy spectrum used for the collapse is based on the fission spectrum of
    the media. In non-fissile media, a default \isotope[238]{U} fission spectrum
    is used \cite{mcc}.
    
    The collapse simplifies the geometry to an infinite and homogeneous medium.
    To reasonably simulate the energy spectrum within the material, cross 
    sections are collapsed assuming an infinite homogeneous mixture composed
    of a single hexagonal assembly. Number densities are calculated for such
    that the number density in the assembly is the number density within the
    material region weighted by the area fraction of that region. Area fractions
    are calculated by using \eref{eq:afrac_first} through \eref{eq:afrac_last}.
    
    To capture the effect of Doppler broadening, cross-section libraries are
    generated for several different material temperatures.
    It is known that the effect of temperature on cross-sections are most
    significant in the fuel region where temperatures can be extreme at high
    reactor powers. Compared to the fuel temperature, the coolant and cladding
    temperatures change relatively little over the operating range of a
    sodium-cooled fast reactor.
    While fuel, clad, and coolant temperatures can be related as above (see
    \sref{sec:radial_conduction_model}), these
    relationships are dependent on reactor power, $Q_{Rx}$, and reactor mass 
    flow rate, $\mdot_{Rx}$, and these values are not known before the
    simulation for a general reactor. Instead, a simplified temperature 
    relationship is used to generate the cross-section libraries.

    In each cross-section library, the coolant is maintained at some nominal
    temperature. For this application, that temperature is $400 \units{K}$. This
    is acceptable because the dominant effect of temperature on the macroscopic
    cross-sections in the coolant is the density change of the fluid, not the
    Doppler effect. Then, the fuel temperature is varied over some range. For
    this application, libraries are generated for average fuel temperatures of 
    $400 \units{K}$, $600 \units{K}$, $900 \units{K}$, and $1200 \units{K}$. For
    each fuel temperature, the clad temperature is related as 
    \begin{equation}
      T_{clad} = w \, T_{fuel} + (1-w) \, T_{cool}
    \end{equation}
    where $T_{fuel}$ is the chosen fuel temperature for the library and
    $T_{cool}$ is the coolant temperature, $400 \units{K}$. For this application
    a weighting of $w=0.4$ provided acceptable results. Temperature in
    non-fissile assemblies is set to $T_{cool}$ during the collapse as there is
    no heat generated in these assemblies and in the axial convection model,
    non-fissile assemblies will have temperature equal to $T_{inlet}$.

    \begin{table}
      \caption{Temperatures Selected for Cross-Section Libraries.}
      \label{tab:xstemps}
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
          \toprule
          $T_{cool} \units{K}$ & $T_{clad} \units{K}$ & $T_{fuel} \units{K}$ \\
          \midrule
          400 & 400 & 400  \\
          400 & 480 & 600  \\
          400 & 600 & 900  \\
          400 & 720 & 1200 \\
          \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
    \end{table}

    Ultimately, the cross-sections are accumulated as four separate libraries at
    temperatures given in \tref{tab:xstemps}. These cross-sections are generated
    at the temperatures specified and the collapses are performed assuming an
    infinite homogeneous mixture of a single assembly. With these libraries
    generated, the average material temperatures calculated in 
    \sref{sec:average_temps} are used to calculate cross-sections within each
    material.

  \subsection{Temperature Dependent Cross Section Calculation}
    Given cross-section libraries calculated at temperatures, an interpolation
    method can be used to calculate the cross-section at a specific temperature.
    The temperature interpolation is unique for each material region and each
    region is briefly discussed.

    Temperatures are updated periodically throughout the neutron diffusion
    calculation. The user may specify a fixed number of power iterations for
    which the diffusion calculation will run before updating the temperatures.
    For a discussion of power iterations, see \sref{sec:power_iterations}. When
    the temperatures are updated, the cross-sections are also updated. Note that
    this update of cross-sections during a power iteration makes the iterative
    method non-linear and the convergence of the method is no longer guaranteed.
    Experimentally, convergence behaves acceptably for typical cases. The
    general procedure to update cross sections is given in
    \algorithmref{algorithm:temperature_update}.

    In \algorithmref{algorithm:temperature_update}, the cross-sections are
    updated using the average material temperatures. Average material
    temperatures are unique within each chunk. Therefor, instead of having
    cross-sections constant throughout the reactor and only a function of
    material, cross sections are now unique and uniquely updated within each
    chunk.

    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{Temperature and Cross-Section Update Procedure.}
      \label{algorithm:temperature_update}
      \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State Calculate flux normalization constant $c$ from

          outlined in \sref{sec:average_temps}.
        \State Update cross sections using average material temperatures.
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \subsubsection{Coolant Cross Sections}
      The main effect on coolant cross sections due to temperature is the change
      in the fluid density. The mass density of the of liquid sodium (as used in
      sodium-cooled fast reactors) is given as a function of temperature
      $\rho(T)$ by a state relationship in \cite{sodiumProp}. Natural sodium is
      entirely composed of \isotope[23]{Na} and has atomic weight $M_{Na} =
      22.989769281 \units{$\frac{\text{gram}}{\text{mol}}$}$ \cite{nuclides}.
      Then, the number density of the coolant is given as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:number_density_sodium}
        N_{Na}(T) = \frac{\rho_{Na}(T) N_A}{M_{Na}}
      \end{equation}
      where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. When temperatures are calculated and
      cross sections are updated, the number density of sodium is updated and
      cross sections are calculated. 
      
      In the temperature dependent cross-section library structure described in
      \tref{tab:xstemps}, all coolant temperatures are the same. Then, the
      macroscopic cross section in the coolant for reaction $x$ is given as
      \begin{equation}
        \Sigma_x = N_{Na}(T_{\infty}) \; \sigma_x
      \end{equation}
      where $N_{Na}$ is calculated according to \eref{eq:number_density_sodium}.
      If, instead, the microscopic coolant temperature were varied as a function
      of temperature, a linear interpolation is performed for $T_{i}<T<T_{i+1}$
      according to
      \begin{equation}
        \Sigma_{x} = N_{Na}(T) 
          \left( \frac{T - T_{i}}{T_{i+1}-T_{i}} 
          (\sigma_{x,i+1} - \sigma_{x,i})  + \sigma_{x,i}\right)
      \end{equation}
      where $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$ are the temperatures associated with the
      tabulated microscopic cross sections $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_{i+1}$
      respectively. 

    \subsubsection{Clad Cross Sections}
      Cross-section temperature dependence within the cladding is due to the
      Doppler effect. Macroscopic cross-sections are tabulated based on the
      cross-section library data at temperatures specified in
      \tref{tab:xstemps}. The Doppler effect is typically small as cladding
      material has fewer absorption resonances than fuel material and cladding
      material does not change temperature as extremely as other reactor
      materials. Because this effect is relatively small, a simple linear
      interpolation is used to interpolate macroscopic cross sections within
      this material. For $T_i < T < T_{i+1}$, the macroscopic cross-section for
      reaction $x$ according to the linear interpolation method is given as
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:xs_linear_interpolation}
        \Sigma_{x} = 
          \frac{T - T_{i}}{T_{i+1}-T_{i}} 
          (\Sigma_{x,i+1} - \Sigma_{x,i})  + \Sigma_{x,i}
      \end{equation}
      where $\Sigma_{x,i}$ and $\Sigma_{x,i+1}$ are the macroscopic
      cross-sections that correspond to temperatures $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$
      respectively. 

    \subsubsection{Bond Cross Sections}
      While the average bond temperature is computed, the temperature dependence
      of bond cross sections is neglected. This is because the bond represents a
      miniscule volume of the reactor and the sodium cross-sections within this
      region do not dictate any larger-scale reactor physics. The bond is the 
      same material as the coolant (sodium). If all coolant (sodium) 
      cross-sections are provided at the same temperature as in 
      \tref{tab:xstemps}, the bond cross sections are set to the same as the 
      coolant cross sections. If the sodium cross sections are provided at
      various temperatures, a linear interpolation is performed according to
      \eref{eq:xs_linear_interpolation}. The assumption that this region has the
      same cross-sections as the coolant has negligible effect on the solution.

    \subsubsection{Fuel Cross Sections}
      Temperature dependence of cross-sections in the fuel region is dominated
      by the Doppler effect. This effect may be large for high fuel temperatures
      and it is important that for realistic cross-sections, this effect be
      simulated properly. Macroscopic cross-sections are tabulated based on
      library data at temperatures specified in \tref{tab:xstemps}. Then, a
      square-root interpolation method is used. The square-root interpolation is
      commonly selected for cross-section interpolation because the Doppler
      effect follow square-root behavior closely. For $T_i < T < T_{i+1}$, the
      macroscopic cross-section for reaction $x$ within the fuel is calculated
      as
      \begin{equation}
        \Sigma_{x} = 
          \frac{\sqrt{T} - \sqrt{T_{i}}}{\sqrt{T_{i+1}}-\sqrt{T_{i}}}
          (\Sigma_{x,i+1} - \Sigma_{x,i})  + \Sigma_{x,i}
      \end{equation}
      where $\Sigma_{x,i}$ and $\Sigma_{x,i+1}$ are the macroscopic
      cross-sections of reaction $x$ corresponding to $T_i$ and $T_{i+q}$
      respectively.
