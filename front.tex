\begin{abstract}
  Renewed interest in advanced nuclear power reactors such as the Versatile Test 
  Reactor (VTR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has encouraged enhanced 
  modeling of Sodium Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs). Since their inception in the 
  early days of nuclear engineering with reactors such as at the Experimental 
  Breeder Reactor and Fermi 1, many new modeling techniques have been developed.
  This work seeks to introduce modern methods to the simulation of SFRs.

  In this work, the multigroup neutron diffusion equation is solved via the
  Finite Element Method (FEM). This method allows for the use of unstructured
  and general meshes. By using an unstructured mesh, physical phenomena such as
  thermal expansion can be modeled and used to distort the mesh. Additionally,
  the FEM will allow for simplified spatial refinement by means of both 
  mesh refinement and the use of higher-order methods without regenerating the 
  mesh.  % TODO WEDGES

  Thermal feedback effects within a SFR are also modeled in this work. A
  simplified thermal hydraulic model is used, modeling both axial heat 
  convection and radial heat conduction. Temperatures from this model are used 
  to calculate on-the-fly, temperature dependent neutron cross-sections to 
  capture the effects of Doppler feedback. Additionally, a thermal expansion 
  model is used to simulate the thermal expansion of fuel and structural 
  components within the reactor.  These effects have been demonstrated to 
  significantly impact reactor behavior in experiments such as those performed 
  at Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II).

  Using these models, a typical SFR is simulated at operating conditions. The 
  models as implemented demonstrate expected reactor behavior for an SFR and can
  be used to visualize the inherent safety features and feedback effects of such 
  a nuclear reactor.

\begin{biography}
  William C. Dawn was born and raised in Stafford, Virginia. He attended public
  schools there for his primary education, participating in the Commonwealth
  Governor's School in High School. William earned a B.S. degree in Nuclear
  Eneingeering from North Carolina State University (NC State) in May 2017. 
  After his Master's degree, William will remain at NC State to pursue a Ph.D.
  degree in Nuclear Engineering. 

  William is a fellow of the Integrated University Program (IUP) facilitated by
  DOE-NE. During his undergraduate and graduate careers, he has had the
  opportunity to work with GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy LLC. and Oak Ridge National
  Laboratory (ORNL). William has also made contributions to the Consortium for
  Advanced Simulation of LWRs (CASL).
