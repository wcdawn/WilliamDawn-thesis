\begin{abstract}
  Renewed interest in advanced nuclear power reactors such as the Versatile Test 
  Reactor (VTR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has encouraged enhanced 
  modeling of fast nuclear power reactors. Since their inception in the early 
  days of nuclear engineering with reactors such as at the Experimental 
  Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) and Fermi 1, many new modeling techniques have been 
  developed. This work seeks to introduce modern methods to the multiphysics 
  simulation of fast reactors.

  In this work, the multigroup neutron diffusion equation is solved via the
  Finite Element Method (FEM), allowing for the use of unstructured
  and general meshes. By using an unstructured mesh, physical phenomena such as
  thermal expansion can be modeled and used to distort the mesh. Additionally,
  the FEM will allow for simplified spatial refinement by means of both 
  mesh refinement and the use of higher-order methods without regenerating the 
  mesh. Unique to this thesis is the use of pentahedral wedge elements in the
  FEM mesh. Wedge elements are selected for their natural description of
  hexagonal geometry common to fast reactors.

  Thermal feedback effects within a fast reactor are also modeled in this work. A
  simplified thermal hydraulic model is used, modeling both axial heat 
  convection and radial heat conduction. Temperatures from this model are used 
  to calculate temperature dependent neutron cross-sections and
  capture reactivity feedback effects. Additionally, a thermal expansion 
  model is used to simulate the thermal expansion of fuel and structural 
  components within the reactor.  These effects have been demonstrated to 
  significantly impact reactor behavior in experiments such as those performed 
  at Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II).

  Using these models, a typical fast reactor is simulated at operating 
  conditions. The models as implemented demonstrate expected reactor behavior 
  for a fast reactor. For the simulated reactor, reactivity feedback 
  coefficients are calculated which would not be possible without a coupled 
  multiphysics model. These results can be used to visualize the inherent safety 
  features and feedback effects of such a nuclear reactor.

\begin{biography}
  William C. Dawn was born and raised in Stafford, Virginia. He attended public
  schools there for his primary education, participating in the Commonwealth
  Governor's School in High School. William earned a Bachelor's of Science 
  degree in Nuclear Eneingeering from North Carolina State University (NC State)
  in May 2017. After his Master's degree, William will remain at NC State to 
  pursue a Ph.D. degree in Nuclear Engineering. 

  William is a fellow of the Integrated University Program (IUP) facilitated by
  U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). During his 
  undergraduate and graduate careers, he has had the opportunity to work with 
  GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Americas LLC (GEH) and Oak Ridge National
  Laboratory (ORNL). William has also made contributions to the Consortium for
  Advanced Simulation of LWRs (CASL).
