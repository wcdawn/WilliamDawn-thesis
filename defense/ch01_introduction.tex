  \begin{itemize}
    \item Manually calculate reactor temperatures for an assumed power
      distribution.
    \item Calculate thermally expanded dimensions for reactor assemblies.
    \item Calculate number densities and area fractions to homogenize
      assemblies.
    \item Use assembly-homogenized number densities to calculate material
      cross-sections in zero-dimension transport solution in \mcc.
    \item Model reactor compositions in \dif and run.
    \item Collect \keff and multigroup scalar fluxes.
