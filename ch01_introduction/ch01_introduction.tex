\section{Motivation}
  Recent interest in advanced and next-generation nuclear power reactor designs
  has encouraged further development of modeling and simulation methods for
  these reactors.  Fast reactors, a class of advanced reactors, operate with
  predominately high-energy (``fast'') neutrons in the fission reaction. Since
  early development of fast reactors, such as  \gls{ebr-i} in 1951 and Fermi 1
  in 1956, there have been significant innovations in both nuclear modeling and
  computational methods. As development of fast reactors is revisited in the
  form of the \gls{vtr} at \gls{inl}, modern improvements in simulation can be
  used to simulate fast reactors with modern best practices. 
  

  Nuclear reactor simulations are inherently multiphysics simulations. For
  example, neutron reaction probabilities are described by cross sections.
  Neutron cross sections are dependent on material temperatures and densities,
  both of which vary over the operating range of a nuclear power reactor. As
  reactor power changes, material temperatures and densities change, therefore
  cross sections change and affect the reactor power. The multiphysics nature
  of the reactor necessitate a simulation of the power distribution within the
  reactor as well as all feedback effects which will be modeled. 
  
  In this thesis, models for simulating fast reactors will be developed and
  demonstrated. Reactor power distribution will be modeled according to the
  multigroup neutron diffusion equation as solved by the \gls{fem} based on
  unstructured meshes with special attention to hexagonal/triangular geometries.
  The multigroup neutron diffusion solution method is verified through
  comparison to both benchmark and analytic solutions. Multiphysics effects are
  modeled including thermal hydraulics and thermal expansion. Thermal hydraulic
  effects are modeled as axial heat convection and radial heat conduction.
  Thermal expansion is modeled using simplified linear expansion models.  The
  methods developed in this work can easily be used for fast reactors with a
  variety of coolants including sodium, lead, or molten salt.

  By employing a modern solution method to the neutron diffusion equation in the
  form of the \gls{fem}, the simulation can take advantage of developments in
  numerical methods including the solution of linear systems.  Additionally, the
  simulation allows for the incorporation of generalized multiphysics effects
  whereas current state-of-the-art techniques (such as \dif) require data
  processing and manual iteration to simulate multiphysics effects. The final
  simulation is designed to simulate an operating fast reactor and estimate
  feedback coefficients.

\section{Geometry Description}
  \label{sec:geometry_description}
  The high-energy neutron spectra inherent to fast reactors results in
  relatively small neutron cross sections.  To compensate for this fact, fast
  reactors are typically designed with hexagonal, triangularly pitched, fuel
  assemblies to maximize fuel packing.  An example of a fast reactor with
  hexagonal fuel assemblies is shown in \fref{fig:reactor_materials}.
  
  \begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reactor_materials}
    \caption{Example of Fast Reactor Materials based on MONJU.}
    \label{fig:reactor_materials}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{prism_hex}
    \caption{Example of Fast Reactor Fuel Assembly Cross Section.}
    \label{fig:prism_hex}
  \end{figure}

  A cross-sectional representation of a hexagonal assembly, is shown in
  \fref{fig:prism_hex}.  This geometry is used to describe material properties
  such as neutron cross sections and is also used to describe coolant flow
  geometries.  Dimensions of assemblies are measured at room temperature and
  will later be expanded according to the thermal expansion model in
  \chref{ch:thermalExpansion}.

  Note the individual rods in \fref{fig:prism_hex} are cylindrical and are
  arranged into a hexagonal assembly. The basic geometry is a metallic fuel
  material within stainless steel cladding. The gap between the fuel and
  cladding is filled by sodium bond to improve thermal conductivity across the
  gap. The rod is wrapped by a steel wire to ensure separation between rods that
  will allow for coolant flow. The wire wrap also serves to encourage the
  mixture of coolant within the assembly. (Note: wire wrap is omitted from
  \fref{fig:prism_hex}.) Many rods are then assembled into an assembly and
  surrounded by a hexagonal can made of steel. This can aids in structural
  stability and prohibits cross-flow between assemblies. 

  The dimensions within a single rod are shown in \fref{fig:pin_model} and the
  dimensions within a hexagonal assembly can are shown in \fref{fig:hex_can}. In
  \fref{fig:hex_can}, $T\!h_{can}$ is the thickness of the assembly can,
  $F\!2\!F$ is the flat-to-flat measurement of the outside of the hexagonal can,
  and \textit{Pitch} is the distance between the center of two rods.  Using the
  geometry described in these figures, the material cross-sectional areas are
  calculated according to the given formulae where $N_{rod}$ is the number of
  rods in the assembly and $A\!P$ is the assembly pitch. $A\!P > F\!2\!F$ to
  account for inter-assembly sodium gaps (see ``Gap'' in \fref{fig:hex_can}).
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:afrac_first}
    A_{total} &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} A\!P^2 \\
    A_{box} &= A_{total} - 
      \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \left(  F\!2\!F - 2 \, T\!h_{can} \right) \\
    A_{wrap} &= N_{rod} \frac{\pi}{4} D_{wrap}^2 \\
    A_{clad} &= N_{rod} \pi (R_C^2 - R_B^2) \\
    A_{bond} &= N_{rod} \pi (R_B^2 - R_F^2) \\
    A_{fuel} &= N_{rod} \pi R_F^2 \\
    A_{cool} &= A_{total} - A_{box} - A_{wrap} - A_{clad} - A_{bond} -
      A_{fuel}\\
    \label{eq:afrac_last}
    A_{struct} &= A_{box} + A_{wrap} + A_{clad}
  \end{align}
  Calculating the areas as above allows for calculation of cross-sectional area
  fractions. Assuming constant dimensions in the axial direction, these area
  fractions are equivalent to volume fractions and are useful for neutron
  cross section homogenization. Additionally, these formulae allow for thermal
  expansion as the liquid sodium in the bond and the liquid coolant are allowed
  to vary to allow for the expansion of other materials.

\section{Cross Section Treatment}
  \label{sec:cross_section_treatment}
  Reactor materials are ``smeared'' into homogeneous regions. This treatment is
  common to fast reactors because of the relatively large neutron
  mean-free-paths compared to the scale of material dimensions. The natural
  choice for these homogeneous regions are the hexagonal assemblies themselves.
  Materials are permitted to be heterogeneous axially.  For this work, four
  distinct regions are modeled: fuel, bond, coolant, and steel. Steel material
  includes cladding, wire wrap, and assembly can. These four regions are then
  homogenized into a hexagonal assembly.

  For realistic reactor simulations cross sections generated consistently with
  the homogenization assumption. In this work, work, multigroup microscopic
  cross sections are generated using the computer program \mcc \cite{mcc}.  The
  cross section generator uses 2,082 fine energy groups to collapse down to an
  arbitrary number of energy-groups. For this simulation, the recommended and
  default 33-group energy structure is used. \mcc solves the
  infinite-homogeneous neutron transport equation for isotopic number densities
  as input by the user.  Cross sections for each assembly type are generated
  separately to accurately simulate the neutron energy spectrum within the
  assembly. This procedure results in a unique material cross sections for each
  assembly type. For example, each assembly type contains steel; therefore,
  there will be a separate steel cross section for each assembly type. Within
  \mcc, the neutron fission  spectrum for fissile media is generated by the
  media's fission spectrum.  Non-fissile homogenized mixtures, such as control
  assemblies or reflector assemblies, the default \isotope[238]{U} fission
  spectrum is assumed.

  Cross section libraries are generated for several different temperatures to
  capture temperature-dependent cross section effects. These libraries are then
  used during the simulation to calculate cross sections as a function of
  material temperatures.  The fuel, clad, and coolant temperatures in a
  simulated reactor can be calculated with a thermal hydraulic model (see
  \chref{ch:thermalHydraulics}), these relationships are functions of reactor
  power and coolant mass flow rate. These parameters are not known before the
  simulation for a general reactor. Instead, a simplified one-dimensional,
  single-channel model is used to estimate temperatures for cross section
  library generation. This model is based on the axial convection and radial
  conduction models in \chref{ch:thermalHydraulics}. Temperatures from the model
  are given in \tref{tab:xstemps}.

  \begin{table}
    \caption{Temperatures Selected for Cross Section Libraries.}
    \label{tab:xstemps}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{crrr}
        \toprule
        Library & $T_{cool} \units{K}$ & $T_{clad} \units{K}$ & 
          $T_{fuel} \units{K}$ \\
        \midrule
        1 & 628.15 & 628.15 & 628.15  \\
        2 & 708.65 & 757.50 & 807.15  \\
        3 & 896.87 & 920.47 & 961.46 \\
        4 & 1072.81 & 1114.83 & 1183.14 \\
        \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{table}

  Note that the maximum temperatures in \tref{tab:xstemps} are greater than 
  temperatures observed at typical reactor operating conditions. This is
  necessary so that even at perturbed reactor conditions (e.g. $110\%$ full
  power), the peak core temperatures can still be interpolated within the
  libraries.

  For each material region, average macroscopic cross
  sections are calculated using microscopic cross sections from \mcc and  
  user-input number densities. Allow $N_{i,j}$ to be the number density for
  isotope ${j=1,2,\ldots,N_{iso}}$ in region ${i=1,2,\ldots,N_{reg}}$.
  Then, the macroscopic cross section for the $x$ reaction type in a homogenized
  hexagonal assembly is defined as
  \begin{equation}
    \Sigma_{x,g}^r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{reg}} \sum_{j=1}^{N_{iso}} V_i N_{j} 
      \sigma_{x,g,i}} {\sum_{i=1}^{N_{reg}}V_i}
  \end{equation}
  where $V_i$ is the volume of region $i$ within the assembly. Assuming cross
  sectional areas within the assembly are constant within a given axial
  elevation, area fractions can be treated as volume fractions. These area
  fractions are calculated according to the area formulae from
  \eref{eq:afrac_first} through \eref{eq:afrac_last}. Finally, the homogenized
  transport cross section is used to calculate the diffusion coefficient.
  \begin{equation}
    D_g = \frac{1}{3 \Sigma_{tr,g}}
  \end{equation}

\section{Thesis Organization}
  In \chref{ch:neutronDiffusion}, the derivation of the \gls{fem} solution to
  the multigroup neutron diffusion equation is presented. Special attention is
  paid to triangular and wedge elements. The resulting eigenvalue problem is
  solved using the Power Method. Results from the diffusion solution are
  verified in two-dimension and three-dimension problems with both analytic and
  benchmark solutions. These verification problems for the neutron diffusion
  equation are presented in \chref{ch:diffusionResults}.

  \chref{ch:thermalHydraulics} presents the formulation of axial heat convection
  and radial heat conduction models for a typical fast reactor. These models are 
  used to calculate material temperatures and update cross sections for the 
  simulation. Results of the numerical model are compared to analytical models 
  and example material temperatures are shown.

  In \chref{ch:thermalExpansion} a simplified thermal expansion model is
  presented. The model assumes linear thermal expansion for given material
  properties and user-specified thermal expansion temperatures. A simple
  demonstration of the effects of thermal expansion on reactivity are presented.

  The combination of all of these models allows for the realistic simulation of
  a fast reactor. In \chref{ch:coupledResults}, the multiphysics models are
  coupled and investigated for a benchmark reactor problem. Using this benchmark
  reactor and the models described, multiphysics reactivity feedback
  coefficients are estimated.
 
  Finally, \chref{ch:conclusions} presents a summary and the conclusions of this
  research. Additionally, recommendations for further research are included.
